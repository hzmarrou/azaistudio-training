# Evaluate the performance of your custom copilot in the Azure AI Studio

In this exercise, you'll explore built-in and custom evaluations to assess and compare the performance of your AI applications with the Azure AI Studio.

This exercise will take approximately **30** minutes.

## Create an AI hub and project in the Azure AI Studio

You start by creating an Azure AI Studio project within an Azure AI hub:

1. In a web browser, open [https://ai.azure.com](https://ai.azure.com) and sign in using your Azure credentials.
1. Select the **Home** page, then select **+ New project**.
1. In the **Create a project** wizard, give a unique name for your project then select **Customize** and set the following settings:
    - **Hub name**: *A unique name*
    - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*
    - **Resource group**: *A new resource group*
    - **Location**: Select **Help me choose** and then select **gpt-35-turbo** in the Location helper window and use the recommended region\*
    - **Connect Azure AI Services or Azure OpenAI**: *Create a new connection*
    - **Connect Azure AI Search**: Skip connecting

    > \* Azure OpenAI resources are constrained at the tenant level by regional quotas. The listed regions in the location helper include default quota for the model type(s) used in this exercise. Randomly choosing a region reduces the risk of a single region reaching its quota limit. In the event of a quota limit being reached later in the exercise, there's a possibility you may need to create another resource in a different region. Learn more about [model availability per region](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#gpt-35-turbo-model-availability)

1. Select **Next** and review your configuration.
1. Select **Create a project** and wait for the process to complete.

## Deploy a GPT model

To use a language model in prompt flow, you need to deploy a model first. The Azure AI Studio allows you to deploy OpenAI models that you can use in your flows.

1. In the navigation pane on the left, under **Components**, select the **Deployments** page.
1. Create a new deployment of the **gpt-35-turbo** model with the following settings:
    - **Deployment name**: *A unique name for your model deployment*
    - **Deployment type**: Standard
    - **Model version**: *Select the default version*
    - **AI resource**: *Select the resource created previously*
    - **Tokens per Minute Rate Limit (thousands)**: 5K
    - **Content filter**: DefaultV2
    - **Enable dynamic quota**: Disabled
1. Wait for the model to be deployed. When the deployment is ready, select **Open in playground**.
1. Change the **System message** to the following:

   ```
   **Objective**: Assist users with travel-related inquiries, offering tips, advice, and recommendations as a knowledgeable travel agent.

   **Capabilities**:
   - Provide up-to-date travel information, including destinations, accommodations, transportation, and local attractions.
   - Offer personalized travel suggestions based on user preferences, budget, and travel dates.
   - Share tips on packing, safety, and navigating travel disruptions.
   - Help with itinerary planning, including optimal routes and must-see landmarks.
   - Answer common travel questions and provide solutions to potential travel issues.
    
   **Instructions**:
   1. Engage with the user in a friendly and professional manner, as a travel agent would.
   2. Use available resources to provide accurate and relevant travel information.
   3. Tailor responses to the user's specific travel needs and interests.
   4. Ensure recommendations are practical and consider the user's safety and comfort.
   5. Encourage the user to ask follow-up questions for further assistance.
   ```

1. Select **Save**.
1. In the chat window, enter the query: `What can you do?` to verify that the language model is behaving as expected.

Now that you have a deployed model with an updated system message, you can evaluate the model.

## Manually evaluate a language model in the Azure AI Studio

You can manually review model responses based on test data. Manually reviewing allows you to test different inputs one at a time to evaluate whether the model performs as expected.

1. In the **Chat playground**, select the **Evaluate**  dropdown from the top bar, and select **Manual evaluation**.
1. Change the **System message** to the same message as you used above (included here again):

   ```
   **Objective**: Assist users with travel-related inquiries, offering tips, advice, and recommendations as a knowledgeable travel agent.

   **Capabilities**:
   - Provide up-to-date travel information, including destinations, accommodations, transportation, and local attractions.
   - Offer personalized travel suggestions based on user preferences, budget, and travel dates.
   - Share tips on packing, safety, and navigating travel disruptions.
   - Help with itinerary planning, including optimal routes and must-see landmarks.
   - Answer common travel questions and provide solutions to potential travel issues.
    
   **Instructions**:
   1. Engage with the user in a friendly and professional manner, as a travel agent would.
   2. Use available resources to provide accurate and relevant travel information.
   3. Tailor responses to the user's specific travel needs and interests.
   4. Ensure recommendations are practical and consider the user's safety and comfort.
   5. Encourage the user to ask follow-up questions for further assistance.
   ```

1. In the **Manual evaluation result** section, you'll add five inputs for which you will review the output. Enter the following five questions as five separate **Inputs**:

   `Can you provide a list of the top-rated budget hotels in Rome?`

   `I'm looking for a vegan-friendly restaurant in New York City. Can you help?`

   `Can you suggest a 7-day itinerary for a family vacation in Orlando, Florida?`

   `Can you help me plan a surprise honeymoon trip to the Maldives?`

   `Are there any guided tours available for the Great Wall of China?`

1. Select **Run** from the top bar to generate outputs for all questions you added as inputs.
1. You can now manually review the outputs for each question by selecting the thumbs up or down icon at the bottom right of a response. Rate each response, ensuring you include at least one thumbs up and one thumbs down response in your ratings.
1. Select **Save results** from the top bar. Enter `manual_evaluation_results` as the name for the results.
1. Using the menu on the left, navigate to **Evaluation**.
1. Select the **Manual evaluations** tab to find the manual evaluations you just saved. Note that you can explore your previously created manual evaluations, continue where you left of, and save the updated evaluations.

## Evaluate your copilot with the built-in metrics

When you have created a copilot with a chat flow, you can evaluate the flow by doing a batch run and assessing the performance of the flow with built-in metrics.

1. Select the **Automated evaluations** tab and create a **New evaluation** with the following settings:
    <details>  
      <summary><b>Troubleshooting tip</b>: Permissions error</summary>
        <p>If you receive a permissions error when you create a new prompt flow, try the following to troubleshoot:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In the Azure portal, select the AI Services resource.</li>
          <li>On the Identity tab under Resource Management, confirm that it is system assigned managed identity.</li>
          <li>Navigate to the associated Storage Account. On the IAM page, add role assignment <em>Storage blob data reader</em>.</li>
          <li>Under <strong>Assign access to</strong>, choose <strong>Managed Identity</strong>, <strong>+ Select members</strong>, and select the <strong>All system-assigned managed identities</strong>.</li>
          <li>Review and assign to save the new settings and retry the previous step.</li>
        </ul>
    </details>
