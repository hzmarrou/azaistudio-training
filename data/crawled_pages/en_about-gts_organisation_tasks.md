Public tasks
The
Gas
Act invests us with a number of statutory tasks that serve the public interest. For example we are responsible for maintaining
gas
supply
levels to small-scale users (households, large buildings and small industrial customers) at temperatures of - 9°C or lower. We are responsible ourselves for contracting the necessary volume and
capacity
.
We also have a duty to intervene if a
supplier
defaults on the
supply
of
gas
to small-scale users. In such cases we must oversee any corrective measures as smoothly as possible – if necessary by taking over the
supply
temporarily – so that the small-scale users concerned can
switch
to another
supplier
as quickly as possible in line with the accepted procedure.
Finally, we ensure that
gas
from the small fields can be taken up in the
gas
transmission
system
.
Statutory tasks
As national
transmission system operator
we are responsible for the management, the operation and the development of the national
transmission
grid on an economic basis. It ensures sufficient transport
capacity
, balances the grid and creates/maintains connections to other grids.
As national
transmission system operator
we are bound by the
Gas
Act
In addition we have the following tasks:
Quality conversion;
To monitor the reliability, quality and safety of the
system
;
To take measures relating to security of
supply
(including peak-period delivery and
supplier
of last resort deliveries);
To provide other network operators with information in order to allow for safe and efficient transport;
To provide users with information that is necessary for efficient access;
Tasks relating to the small-fields policy (transport of natural
gas
from small fields).
We are not allowed to carry out activities such as production, delivery or purchase of
gas
by means of which it enters into competition with other parties unless this relates to the performance of activities for the legal tasks.
We are bound by the
Gas
Act. In this Act it is stated that the national
transmission
operator has to treat all its customers equally in equal circumstances. To guarantee this we have drawn up a code
GTS
, as is mandatory, in which is specified what is allowed and what is not allowed. All employees of our company signed a letter for complying with the code. We also have separate Speak Up rules which has been developed concerning reporting potential abuses. Furthermore we publish the compliance report of the code (nalevingsverslag reglement). Also the code of conduct of Gasunie applies to employees of
GTS
. Each member of
GTS
must accept and comply with the standards set out in the code of conduct.
