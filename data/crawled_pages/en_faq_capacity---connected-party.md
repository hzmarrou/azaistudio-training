Capacity
It is important that both minimum and maximum
capacity
are known. The maximum
capacity
is given in normal cubic metres per
hour
at a temperature of 0°C and a pressure of 1013 mbar and with an energy content Hs of 35,17 MJ/m3. The maximum
capacity
is a determining factor for the design and dimensions of the
connection point
. We need the minimum
capacity
in conjunction with the off-take pattern in order to verify the
measuring equipment
provided by connected parties.
The off-take pattern raises questions about anticipated use. For example, connected parties may consume more
gas
in the winter for space heating, so a summer/winter pattern is involved here. Sometimes there is also a continuous (low) basic off-take with regular peaks that are a multiple of the basic off-take.
In brief, the off-take pattern indicates how connected parties’ installations are operated and provides insight into the possible fluctuations in
gas
consumption between minimum and maximum
capacity
.
