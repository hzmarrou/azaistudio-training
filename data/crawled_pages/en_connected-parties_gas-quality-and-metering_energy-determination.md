When
gas
is transferred from the
GTS
network,
GTS
determines the
quantity of energy
transferred.
This energy determination is very important for correct invoicing.
GTS
and its customers both use the data for invoicing. The correct determination of the
quantity of energy
transferred is guaranteed in the fiscal process. To guarantee the quality of this fiscal process, numerous checks have been built into the process, certified by an independent body (ISO 9001). The fiscal process is described in a number of documents that are further explained below. In addition, a performance evaluation is regularly carried out.
