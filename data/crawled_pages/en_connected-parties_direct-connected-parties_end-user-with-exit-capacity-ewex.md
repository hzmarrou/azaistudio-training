If you are a
directly connected party
to the national
gas
grid, you can agree on your required
capacity
with your
supplier
and/or
shipper
. Your
shipper
will then book the
transmission capacity
in the
GTS
network. However, you can also opt to book your own site
exit capacity
directly with
GTS
, provided that you will take on the role of
end user with exit capacity
(AMEX) with
GTS
, with the required licence (L licence).
Book your transport
capacity
directly with
GTS
Previously, it was common for direct connected industries to have an AMEX licence, as this enabled the
connected party
in question to book its
transmission capacity
for an extended period, thereby guaranteeing the security of its
gas
transmission
. Nowadays,
GTS
reserves the booked
capacity
for you on your
connection
, in the current year, up until 1 December of the following year. The
exit capacity
is booked as outlined in Article 2.1.2.a of the
Gas
Transmission
Code. Connected parties are therefore guaranteed that the
capacity
booked for them in the current year will also be available to them in the following year, as long as the
capacity
has been booked on their
connection
before 1 December. Booking requests submitted after 1 December in the current year are processed on a first come, first served basis. The principle of booking
exit capacity
, thereby guaranteeing their capacities, means it is no longer necessary for directly connected parties to have or take on the AMEX role.
If you decide that you would like to book the
exit capacity
on your
connection
yourself anyway, you will need to apply for the required AMEX L licence. You can do so by completing the Licensing application form,  and signing and emailing the form in PDF format to the
Customer Desk
at
[email protected]
.
Creditworthiness
In order to attain the  AMEX status, you must meet the creditworthiness requirements set out in Annex 1 of the
Gas
Transmission
Code. This means that we will request additional financial security from you if the booking value (including VAT) of your
contracted capacity
exceeds your credit limit. The AMEX must provide
GTS
with the requested security no later than two months before the start date of the
transmission
booking. Additional security must be valid for four months after the end of the
contracted capacity
period. The AMEX’s creditworthiness will be continuously monitored during the term of the contracted
exit capacity
. Please click here to find out more about creditworthiness and

Transferring
capacity
Once you have booked your
exit capacity
, you need to ‘transfer’ it to your
shipper
. You can do so through your
supplier
, with whom you have entered into a
gas supply contract
.
Transmission
rights are transferred through a trade. There are two types of trade, i.e. a Transfer of
Capacity
Rights (ToC) and a Transfer of Usage (ToU). With a ToC, both the
capacity
rights and the usage rights are transferred and the
shipper
to whom the
capacity
was traded pays
GTS
for the
transmission
rights. With a ToU, only the usage rights are transferred and the AMEX continues to pay for the
transmission capacity
. To initiate your transfer with
GTS
, please use the Changes to/transfer of (a)
network area
application form in the Downloads and forms section of our website.
The transfer must be registered no later than 10 working days before the
gas
transmission
start date and the
supplier
must send a
switch
message to
GTS
at least 5 working days before the start of the
supply
. Please click here to find out more about
switch
messages.
As of 2020, there is no fee charged for the transfers of rights (ToC or ToU). The transfer is considered a condition on which the
transmission
service is provided, so the costs are covered by the all-in
transmission
tariffs as specified in Appendix 1 of the TSC.
