If a lot of nitrogen is being used, part of this nitrogen will come from the "Firm Volume Restricted" section (see
Nitrogen report
). The 'nitrogen storage meter' and related graphical or numerical retrievals provide information about the volume of nitrogen available in the nitrogen storage.

Nitrogen storage meter
The nitrogen storage meter shows the most up-to-date status of the volume of nitrogen available in the nitrogen storage (in m3(n)). The meter scale runs from 12.300.000 (bottom left) to the maximum working volume of nitrogen in the storage (24.600.000 bottom right).  This scale contains four colours. There is a dark-green section on the right, if the volume of nitrogen available is shown to be in this area the nitrogen storage is to be used as normal. In the middle is an orange section, if the nitrogen volume reaches this area a REMIT warning is sent, see below. The red section shows the reserve quantity of nitrogen in the storage. If the actual, available quantity of nitrogen reaches this area, the nitrogen storage can no longer be used (including REMIT report, see below). If the light-green section is reached from the dark-green section, there is no alarm. If a REMIT report was sent, this is only withdrawn if the pointer leaves the light-green area and moves towards the dark-green zone. The pointer on this scale and the amount underneath the meter shows the actual working volume. The percentage gives the part of the working volume which is available.
Nitrogen storage graph
The nitrogen storage graph shows the volume of nitrogen available per
hour
in the past 14 days (in m3(n)). The same areas and colours are used as those on the nitrogen storage meter. The yellow line shows the actual working volume at the end of every
hour
(reserve and available).
Nitrogen storage report
This report is part of the nitrogen report. The actual and maximum working volumes of the nitrogen storage (in m3(n)) will be shown. Users can choose from various aggregations (
hour
, day, month, calendar year and
gas
year) and various periods. The value at the end of the aggregation period will be shown. For example with aggregation month, de value of the last
hour
of that month will be shown.
Nitrogen storage volume and REMIT reports
REMIT reports
will be issued as soon as there is hardly any working volume available in the nitrogen storage.
Nitrogen      volume in the orange area (see nitrogen storage meter). An advance      notification/warning is issued to indicate that the nitrogen storage is      almost empty. Market participants are asked to adjust their H-
gas
/G-
gas
balance to reduce nitrogen use.
Nitrogen      volume in the red area (see nitrogen storage meter). Nitrogen is      being used from the nitrogen storage reserve
capacity
. A REMIT report      is issued to indicate that the nitrogen storage is empty. Market      participants may be called upon to adjust their H-
gas
/G-
gas
balance to      reduce nitrogen use.
Nitrogen      volume moves from the light-green to the dark-green area. If a REMIT      report was issued previously, this is withdrawn.
FAQ
What is the Subdivision of G-gas and H-gas
The
GTS
transport
system
contains two physically separate networks that are linked together by blending stations. There is a low-calorific
system
intended to
supply
exits with G-
gas
or L-
gas
and an high-calorific
system
for H-
gas
exits.
Most entries are linked directly to the G-
gas
or H-
gas
system
. However, some entries lie between G-
gas
and H-
gas
in terms of quality. They are incorporated into the G-
gas
or H-
gas
system
via
QC
or
RQC
.
What is QC?
High-quality gases are converted into lower-quality gases by means of a process called
QC
(Quality Conversion)
.
The G-
gas
system
regularly experiences entry shortages, while there is a surplus of gases with a higher Wobbe ( H-
gas
). The surplus H-
gas
is converted into G-
gas
(
QC
) via blending stations. The amount of
QC
(converted H-
gas
) will be shown via the ‘
QC
-meter’ on the
QC/RQC dashboard
. If there is little
QC
, then the H-
gas
can be blended at no cost with other gases into  G-
gas quality
(this is called enrichment). If a large amount of H-
gas
has to be converted, then it must be converted into G-
gas
by adding  nitrogen (this
gas
is called ‘pseudo G-
gas
’).
When nitrogen is used, the
gas
transport network must be controlled in such a way that the H-gases with the lowest Wobbes are the first to be transported to the blending stations. This gives the greatest
capacity
for conversion at the lowest costs.
The amount of nitrogen available and the level of its use are shown on this dashboard via the Nitrogen meter on the
QC
/
RQC
dashboard. This means that the maximum
QC
limits can be clearly distinguished by the amount of nitrogen not yet used. See more detailed information at the
Nitrogen report
.
Part of the nitrogen may be delivered out of a nitrogen storage. The ‘N2-storage meter’ on the
QC
/
RQC
dashboard shows the actual volume available of this storage.
What is RQC?
The process of converting low-quality gases into higher-quality gases (H-
gas
) is called
RQC
(Reverse Quality Conversion).
Sometimes the
gas
transport
system
has a shortage of H-
gas
entries and a surplus of gases with a lower Wobbe. The surplus low-Wobbe gases are added to the H-
gas
via blending stations.
It is impossible to indicate the
RQC
capacity
in advance, as it depends on the current qualities of all gases. The
RQC
capacity
can be between 0 m3(n)/h and approximately 1,5 mln. m3(n)/h. The amount of use  of
RQC
will be shown by the ‘
RQC
-meter’ on the
QC
/
RQC
dashboard.
As already indicated, many entries lie between G-
gas
and H-
gas
in terms of quality. In general, the
QC
need is high, so all these gases are converted into G-
gas
by means of
QC
. But if the
QC
need decreases  continuously, then gradually more of these gases will be converted to H-
gas
by means of
RQC
. At the borderline, both
RQC
and
QC
take place simultaneously. It is assumed by definition that the total transport
system
is in
RQC
mode if the amount of converted
RQC
gas
exceeds the amount of converted
QC
gas
.
How up-to-date is the data displayed on the QC/RQC Dashboard?
About 20 minutes after every
hour
the information of that
hour
becomes available.The ‘meters’ show the status of the last available
hour
. The graphs and reports show the hourly data updated to include the last available
hour
. The daily, monthly and yearly aggregations contain data up to and including the last complete
gas day
.
Which ‘meter’ is displayed on the home page?
One of the meters on the
QC
/
RQC
dashboard is the most important, depending on the current
QC
/
RQC
status. The current status is displayed below the meters on the dashboard. The most important meter is displayed on the home page of the
GTS
website.
If the
gas
transport
system
is using nitrogen for
QC
, then the Nitrogen meter is important and will be displayed on the home page. If no nitrogen is used but the transport
system
is still in
QC
-mode than the ‘
QC
-meter’ will be displayed. If the transport
system
is in
RQC
-mode than the ‘
RQC
-meter’ will be displayed.
