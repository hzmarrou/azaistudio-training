When is my POS reset?
In principle, your POS is never reset. Settlements having an effect on the POS are WDBA’s. It is only when a WDBA is performed that volumes are set off pro rata against the positions (POSs) of the causers. Shippers with a position opposite to the SBS at the time of the balancing action are not affected.
Is the POS available at hh:15 (DPM M&A, chapter 2) really going to be published later at hh:20 (DPM M&A, paragraph 3.12)?
The accountable POS will, apart from in exceptional situations, indeed be published between xx:15 and xx:20. The reason for this is that the near real-time allocations of the CSS are only available at xx:13. This is because actual near real-time allocations are used for determining the accountable POS and not the allocation from a previous
hour
as was the case for the determining the forecast POS.
Is the accountable POS only available at hh:15 for portfolios based on near real-time allocations which are only available after 5 minutes past the hour (such as RNB/PNB,TTF-B, etc.)?
The accountable POS is indeed only available between xx:15 and xx:20.
For a POS where no near real-time allocations are needed that are only available after 5 minutes past the
hour
(such as RNB/PNB,TTF-B, etc.), the prognosticated POS for xx:00 (which is available before xx:05) is equal to the accountable POS at xx:15 – xx:20.
Is it possible to create multiple POSs?
Yes, multiple portfolios with multiple POSses. A POS is per
portfolio
.
Will the WDBA notification be visible on Gasport screen? We keep the Gasport POS/SBS page open at all times. What is the content of the notification?
For the Within Day Balancing Actions a message is displayed immediately when the prognosis is that an order on the exchange platform is required. This message will be displayed on all screens under the Dispatching menu item.
The message that will be constructed has the following format:
GTS
WDM Order Forecast at: <xx:05>/<xx:10> LET -
GTS
<buys>/<sells>
Product: <single
hour
>/<remainder of day>
Amount per
hour
: <value> MW/h
Total amount: <value> MWh
SBS forecast value: <+/-value> MWh
