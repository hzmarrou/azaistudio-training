The prerequisite for an all-embracing and liberalised
gas
market is transparent and non-discriminatory access to the national
gas
transport and
distribution network
for all market players. All end users in the Netherlands, such as consumers and businesses, are free to choose their own
gas
supplier
.
The Netherlands has a
system
of regulated access to the network. This means that there is an independent, regulatory authority in place that approves access conditions and tariffs and ensures that they comply with the provisions of the Dutch
Gas
Act.
In the Netherlands this task has been entrusted to the Dutch Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM). The ACM is an autonomous government body whose responsibilities include regulating the
gas
and electricity markets in the Netherlands. The main conditions for gaining access to
gas
transport networks, which therefore also includes
GTS
’s network, are set out in the Tariff Code and the
Gas
Conditions. The Network Code that underpins these was adopted by the ACM on the basis of the proposals submitted for this purpose by the Joint Network Companies. This is a combination of the local
distribution
companies with
GTS
as operator of the national transport
system
.
GTS
has also drawn up and laid down a number of specific provisions and conditions for access to the network in its
Transmission
Service Conditions, TSC, which supplement the Network Code.
GTS
also offers several services that are included within the legally assigned tasks. These services and the associated conditions are also described in the TSC. The TSC is a document that has the status of contractually established general provisions and forms part of the bilateral contract concluded by
GTS
with its customers. In addition, bilateral contracts also set out the conditions relating to the
system connection
between the
national grid
and the ultimate consumer of the
gas
,
distribution
companies or operators of adjacent networks. Where an end consumer with a local
distribution
company is concerned, a
Connection Agreement
will be concluded, while a contract with an operator of an adjacent network is called a Network
Connection Agreement
