As the future will be driven by sustainable practices, the Netherlands is committed to renewable sources such as wind, sun and green
gas
/biogas.
Sustainably produced
gas
will represent an essential element of the future energy
supply
. Network operators consider a volume of 2 billion m3 green
gas
by 2030 to be realistic.
We want to do our utmost to facilitate the development of sustainably produced
gas
.
One of the issues faced by potential green
gas
producers is the available feed-in
capacity
in the Dutch
gas
network. The demand for
gas
is heavily dependent on the seasons: demand is high in winter and low in summer. Demand in urban areas is also greater than in rural areas and the demand for
gas
is high during the day and relatively low at night.
Green
gas
is produced by fermentation, a continuous process and therefore a continuous
supply
. This can lead to an imbalance between
supply
and demand in summer.
The network operators have developed a
working method
together with the aim of creating sufficient feed-in
capacity
for green
gas
producers at the lowest social costs.
The image below shows several measures offered jointly by network operators:
Each case is examined to see whether there is sufficient scope available to feed in: if sufficient feed-in
capacity
is available then the measures will not be required. A structural restriction to feeding-in will trigger an investigation into which technical measures can expand the feed-in
capacity
at the lowest social costs.
In addition to the measures that
GTS
is offering in partnership with local
distribution
companies,
GTS
also intends to offer its own individual measures.

Become a green
gas
injector
We have described below how you can become an
injector
into
GTS
's network.
A
connection
with
GTS
You are intending to produce green
gas
and want to feed this
gas
into the public
gas
network of the local
distribution
company (LDC) or the national
network operator
(
GTS
). To organise this, please contact us using the form below.
This application form asks you to provide your contact details, the desired green
gas
production site and injection
capacity
with associated
gas quality
.
The process of becoming a green
gas
injector
for
GTS
involves the following three elements:
Feasibility study
We assume that you will need an SDE++ subsidy (sustainable energy transition subsidy scheme) for producing your green
gas
supply
. In order to apply for the SDE++ subsidy, you will need to submit a (positive) feasibility study from the
network operator
to the Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO).
GTS
will produce this study if you have requested this via the application form mentioned above.
You will receive global information regarding technical feasibility and delivery time for the
connection
from us within 10 days of your request or we will let you know if we need more time.
Investment Agreement
If, based on the feasibility study, you make a firm decision to invest, you can confirm it by signing and returning the ‘application for a new
connection
’ form. Based on this application, we will initiate a
connection
project and consult with you as soon as possible on the construction and design of the
connection
pipeline. After defining the scope, functional requirements and project specifications together with you, we will send you an Investment Agreement for completion of the
connection
. The Investment Agreement signed by you represents your instructions to
GTS
to build the
connection
. NB: The lead time for construction of the
connection
can be two to three years.
Grid
Connection Agreement
You will conclude a Grid
Connection Agreement
with us before the
connection
is brought into use.  This contains all the necessary technical arrangements for the
gas
supply
(quantity, pressure, quality).
Statutory requirements for the injection of green
gas
The statutory provisions and conditions for injecting (green)
gas
into the
national grid
are relevant to you. The
injection code gas TSO
provides a broad outline of these and more details, in terms of quality, composition and pressure, are contained in the Ministerial
decree on gas quality
.
Gas
measurement
As mentioned, you yourself are responsible for performing verifiable measurements which should comply with the ‘functional requirements for fiscal metering’. Doing so guarantees that both the design and management of the measurements will be standardised as far as possible. The requirements for this are set out in the document mentioned below.

Other information
Green
gas
certificates (Vertogas)
Green
gas
certificates were created to promote trading in green
gas
. Green
gas
certificates make it possible to separate the physical green
gas
product from its use. It offers consumers the opportunity to ‘green’ their activities by purchasing green
gas
without being physically connected to a green
gas
producer.
Vertogas is responsible for issuing green
gas
certificates. The certificates issued by this company guarantee the origin of the green
gas
. They give assurance to buyers that the green
gas
purchased is of the same quality as natural
gas
.  The certificate also provides information about the raw materials from which the green
gas
has been produced.
Timing measures
It is very important for the timing of your investment to be in line with the timing of the work planned in for our pipeline. The lead time for constructing a
connection point
is, on average, around 2.5 years and may depend on the
connection
options at your chosen site. We would therefore recommend contacting
GTS
at the earliest possible stage. We can demonstrate the
connection
options for your site without any further obligation.
