1. Indicative demand assessment
This is the non-binding demand assessment phase where market parties can submit their
capacity
demand to the TSO’s by filling out a demand indication form. In consultation with the neighboring TSO’s, it is decided whether the non-binding demand indication(s) give rise to offering incremental
capacity
. If so, the next phase of the process will start. In this incremental
capacity
process this first phase ran from the 5 July 2023 until 30 of August 2023.
2. Design phase
In this phase, technical studies are carried out and a financial assessment is made of the measures to be taken. Together with the other adjacent TSOs, projects are defined for the realization of incremental
capacity
. After consultation of the market parties the TSO’s will decide upon the final project proposals.
3. Approval of the project proposals
The project proposals will be submitted to the national regulatory authorities for approval.
4. Binding demand assessment
The incremental
capacity
to be developed is offered at the auction. The results of the auction are input for an economic test. The outcome of the economic test determines the implementation of the proposed projects.
5. Realization of the proposed projects that passed the economic test
Market parties can make their non-binding demand indications known to
GTS
at any time via the demand indication form below. However, for the incremental
capacity
process 2023-2025,
GTS
will only include non-binding demand indications that have been submitted to
GTS
before the 31
st
of August 2023.
