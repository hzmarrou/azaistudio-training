The
Connection Agreement
(Aansluitovereenkomst (AO)) is applicable to the connections of industries connected to
GTS
’s
gas
transmission
grid. The
Connection
Code
Gas
TSO specifies that this type of agreement is a condition for the creation of a physical link between
GTS
and the
connection
.
In addition to the
Connection Agreement
mentioned above,
GTS
also uses two other kinds of agreement, i.e.:
The
System
Connection Agreement
(Systeemverbindingsovereenkomst (SVO)): applicable to connections between the national
gas
transmission
network and the
gas
transmission
networks of local
distribution
companies (LDC)
The Grid
Connection Agreement
(GCA): applicable to other connections such as injectors (e.g. of green
gas
), border stations and storage facilities.
Which areas are regulated by the
Connection Agreement
(AO)?
The
Connection Agreement
(AO) covers all agreements relating to the physical link between the
connected party
and the national
gas
transmission
network. The
Connection Agreement
(AO) also describes the conditions under which the
gas
is delivered (pressure, quality,
capacity
). The
Connection Agreement
also provides both the
connected party
and
GTS
with clarity regarding their respective responsibilities and tasks.
In accordance with the
Connection
Code
Gas
TSO,
GTS
may only make
gas
available at a
connection
if a
Connection Agreement
has been concluded for that
connection
.
The different elements of the
Connection Agreement
(AO)
The
Connection Agreement
(AO) is signed by both parties and consists of the following elements:
The agreement
in which the following are laid down, among others: contracting parties, the relationship with the
Gas
Codes, the General Conditions, the relevant legislation and regulations, effective date and contact details in the event of disasters;
The General Conditions
which complement the
Gas
Codes, being the most recent conditions adopted and brought into force by the Dutch Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) on the basis of article 12f of the Dutch
Gas
Act (the
Connection
Code
Gas
TSO forms part of the
Gas
Codes) and which regulate how to handle
gas quality
, pressure,
capacity
, measuring, termination, building (and planting) rights, liability and
force majeure
;
The ‘Technical Specifications’
lay down the specific parameters of the
connection
, such as
capacity
, pressure,
gas quality
and any supplementary provisions;
The
Connection Agreement
may contain provisions that deviate from the standard agreement. These may be provisions such as
gas
heating by a
connected party
for which the
connected party
receives a payment from
GTS
, the absence of a reserve metering and/or control run, odorisation and pressure agreements.
The standard transfer point
is one meter downstream of the insulating joint and consequently not described in the
Connection Agreement
. If a non-standard transfer point applies, this will be described in the
Connection Agreement
. For a better understanding of the transfer point it is possible to request a diagrammatic drawing.
Below you will find the General Terms and Conditions regarding the
Connection Agreement
.

What does it cost to terminate the connection?
There is no charge for terminating the
connection
but you do have to bear in mind the 3-month notice period. Your contractual obligations remain in force until the actual termination date.
Any
contracted capacity
cannot unfortunately be cancelled, except in the case of bankruptcy or business cessation, when contractual obligations arising from booked
capacity
are also terminated. 50% of the tariff of the remaining booking will be charged to the holder of the
capacity
for that.
Which articles apply to the termination of a connection?
Article 16 of the General Conditions for
Connection
Agreements, version 3.1 accompanying the
connection agreement
describe the conditions under which termination is possible.
In addition, article 6.A.11 of the TSC deals with the
supply
of
transmission capacity
in the event of bankruptcy or business cessation.
When will the connection be dismantled?
We will consult you when we start to dismantle the
connection
or part of it.
GTS
is responsible for removing the
connection
, including the connecting pipeline on your site. We will start to dismantle the
connection
within 2 years of the termination of the
connection agreement
.
The
supply
pipeline must always be depressurised before work can be done in the immediate vicinity of the
connection
or the
supply
pipeline.
How can I terminate the connection?
To dismantle the complete
connection
or a part of the
connection
, please look at “
