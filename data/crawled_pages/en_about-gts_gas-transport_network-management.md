We also have duties relating to the management and development of the
transmission
system
.
As national
network operator
,
GTS
is responsible for ensuring sufficient transport
capacity
, a balanced transport network and the necessary connections to other
gas
transport networks. The safety, efficiency and reliability of the
system
are key issues.
Command and control
We control the transport
system
from our Dispatching Centre (CCP). Here we monitor all aspects relating to physical
gas
transport, including
gas
flow and
gas
pressure. Our main concern is to ensure that all our customers are getting enough
gas
at the right time and that enough is being injected. Any faults are dealt with immediately by the CCP, for example, by opening or closing valves remotely. This is done through a specially designed computer program called ARGOS (Automated Remote
Gas
transmission
and Online Simulation). Another important computer program is Nimbus (
Nomination
Information Modules for Data Exchange and SCADA Management), the
system
used by ‘contract dispatchers’ to control both day and night orders of
gas
transport.
Measurement
Network management also covers our
gas
measurement accounts
system
(which measures volume, energy and
gas
composition for invoicing purposes). This particular management process looks closely at the quality of the measurement process, in which technical functions such as accuracy, reliability and timeliness play an important part, as well as the preparation of measurement data (including supervision and allocation) and determination of final accounting data.
Planning
Our pipeline network carries four types of
gas
flow:
gas
from the Netherlands for domestic consumption and for export,
gas
from foreign producers for domestic consumption (imports) and foreign market (transit).
Planning is a vital part of network management. Only through planning can we anticipate market trends, provide new services and invest in the construction of pipelines, compression
capacity
and
gas
storage. We therefore study problems affecting the main transport network and look for appropriate solutions. We advise about possible adjustments and carry out preparations for new construction and maintenance projects in the transport network.
In order to plan effectively it is essential to obtain information from other market parties. We have developed a special procedure for this purpose which we carry out every year.
