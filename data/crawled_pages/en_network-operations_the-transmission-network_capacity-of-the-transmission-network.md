The technical capacities  at entry points and exit points are updated on a regular basis. The rules for the calculation of the
technical capacity
are included in the Dutch
gas
regulation: annex 2 of the transportation conditions.
The determination of the
technical capacity
is based among other things on prognoses: the expectations in future years of the development of capacities at entry and exit points.  There is also a role for the following design conditions: qualified choices with regard to technical capabilities of the transportation grid or components of the grid; physical and chemical aspects of the natural
gas
transported; expectations with regard to the usage of entry points and exit points or combinations of exit points and entry points.
The
gas
conditions require the publication on the website of
GTS
of the prognoses (paragraph 2.2.1 of annex 2) and the design conditions (paragraph 2.2.2 of annex 2) that
GTS
applies to determine the
technical capacity
. This requirement is met with the report “Ontwerp uitgangspunten transportsysteem”.
Detailed physical and chemical properties of
gas
transportation and natural
gas
are assembled in "Physical Properties of Natural Gases, 1980, NV Nederlandse Gasunie”.
