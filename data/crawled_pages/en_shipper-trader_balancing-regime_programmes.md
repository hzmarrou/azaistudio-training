Below follows a description of what programmes are, what types of programmes there are, who is required to submit programmes and what programmes should look like.
A programme specifies the hourly predictions of the
gas
flows for each
portfolio
for the following
gas day
. We use the programmes, among other things, to calculate the space in the zones. Every day, before 14:00 hours, all shippers must submit a programme for the next day. The programmes are submitted to us for each
portfolio
.
We check whether the programmes are correct (see below) and inform the shippers of the result. The deadline for this process is 22:00 hours (day ahead).
VPPV: transfer of
programme responsibility
in our network
The virtual point for the transfer of
programme responsibility
is the VPPV. The VPPV is a virtual point all the
gas
in the
system
will flow through.
As laid down in the Dutch
Gas
Act, the VPPV facilitates the transfer of
programme responsibility
. The VPPV is a combination of the trades on the TTF plus the transfer of a
shipper
’s own
entry programme
to its own
exit programme
.

diagram showing entries, exits and VPPV.
Entry programme
In an
entry programme
, the
shipper
specifies the total volume of physical entry for the specific
portfolio
for each
hour
(sum of MP1 and MP2 in Figure 1). Furthermore, the
shipper
specifies the net volume of
gas
for each
hour
in respect of which
programme responsibility
is transferred to the VPPV.
Exit programme
In an
exit programme
, the
shipper
specifies the total volume of physical exit for the specific
portfolio
for each
hour
(MP3 plus MP4 in Figure 1) distributed over two exit flows: The exit flow for household customers and the exit flow for other customers. Furthermore, the
shipper
specifies the net
gas
volume for each
hour
in respect of which
programme responsibility
is transferred to the VPPV. A
shipper
with small-scale users in its
portfolio
must apply the damping formula. A
shipper
without small -scale users in its
portfolio
may apply the damping formula in its
exit programme
if he has indicated this in advance.
Shippers can add their trade transactions to the entry and exit programmes; There is no need to
supply
separate programmes. When a
shipper
applies damping, it is advisable to add the trade transactions to the
entry programme
.
Trade programme
Pure traders (i.e. parties who solely trade on the TTF) must submit a trade programme without physical entry or exit. The programme specifies the net traded volume for each
hour
.
When a trade is agreed upon between parties, the parties should also discuss when they will include the trade transaction in the programme. Our guideline is that transactions concluded before 21:00 hours are to be included in the programme. This gives both parties sufficient time (before the closing time at 22:00 hours) to include the transaction.
Of course, trading can still continue on the TTF after the 22:00 hours deadline for submission of programmes; This also applies to renominations at entry and exit points.
Damping in exit programmes
The damping formula is only applied to exit programmes. The damping formula ensures that for each
hour
, the combination of entry and exit matches the physical conditions of the
gas
transport network. Every day, before 09:00 hours, we publish the parameters of the damping formula for the next day. The damping formula is described in detail on our website.
What type of programme do you have to submit and in which programme you need to include your possible trades?
The type of programme you have to submit depends on the types of
capacity
that have been booked. The possible situations are shown below.
You are only active on TTF
In this case you only submit a Trade programme, containing the sum of the trades.
You have booked both entry and
exit capacity
In this case you must submit both Entry and
Exit programme
. When you are also active on TTF, the sum of the trades should be preferably　 included in the
Entry programme
.
You have booked only
entry capacity
, no
exit capacity
In this case you must submit only an
Entry programme
. When you are also active on TTF, include the sum of the trades in this programme.
You have booked only
exit capacity
, no
entry capacity
In this case you must submit only an
Exit programme
. When you are also active on TTF, include the sum of the trades in this programme.
Programme checks
In order to ensure that the national
gas
transport network is balanced over the next
gas day
, we also check whether the transfers on the VPPV are compatible as regards the counterparty, volume, time period and direction. For entry, trade and exit programmes without damping, we will check if the entry and exit amounts are equal for each
hour
. For exit programmes with damping, we will check if the formula has been correctly applied. If a programme is not correct, we will report this and apply certain corrective actions. Parties may still send in amended programmes up to the closing time of 22:00 hours.
