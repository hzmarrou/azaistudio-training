An incremental
capacity
process is initiated at least every two years,  immediately after the auction for annual
capacity
closes. At the request of market parties,
GTS
will also include the Surrender of
Capacity
(SOC) service in the incremental
capacity
process from 2019 onwards.
The main steps in the incremental
capacity
process are:
Indicative demand assessment This is the non-binding demand assessment phase where market parties can      submit their
capacity
demand to the TSO’s by filling out a      demand indication form. In consultation with the neighboring TSO’s, it is      decided whether the non-binding demand indication(s) give rise to offering      incremental
capacity
. If so, the next phase of the process will start. In      this incremental
capacity
process this first phase will run from the 5
th
of      July 2021 until the 30
th
of August 2021.
Design phase In this phase, technical studies are carried out and a financial      assessment is made of the measures to be taken. Together with other TSOs,      projects are defined for the realization of incremental
capacity
. After      consultation of the market parties the TSO’s will decide upon the final      project proposals.
Approval of the project      proposals The project proposals will be submitted to the national regulatory      authorities for approval.
Binding demand assessment The incremental
capacity
to be developed is offered at the auction. The      results of the auction are input for an economic test. The outcome of the      economic test determines the implementation of the proposed projects.
Realization of the proposed      projects that passed the economic test
Market parties can make their non-binding demand indications known to
GTS
at any time via the demand indication form below. However, for the incremental
capacity
process 2021-2023,
GTS
will only include non-binding demand indications that have been submitted to
GTS
before August 31, 2021.
