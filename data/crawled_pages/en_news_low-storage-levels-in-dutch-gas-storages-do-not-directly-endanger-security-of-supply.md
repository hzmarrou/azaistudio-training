Security of
supply
Although additional
gas
extraction from storage has been observed since the autumn of 2024, there is still a large volume available in absolute terms. Security of
supply
is therefore guaranteed. However, a severe winter could lead to a tight
supply
and higher
gas
prices in the wholesale market. This could affect costs for households and businesses, depending on developments in the coming months.
Storage levels
The current fill level of
gas
storage is lower than observed in recent years. This is due to an extraction rate significantly higher than can be expected based on temperature trends alone. Without this additional extraction, the fill level in the Netherlands would currently be about 15 percentage points higher. Although a similarly low fill level is observed in France, for Europe as a whole, the fill level is comparable to previous years.
International and Geopolitical Influences
The Netherlands is increasingly dependent on
gas
imports and a well-functioning European
gas
market. Developments and uncertainties within the Northwest European region therefore affect the Dutch situation. Currently, there is sufficient
gas
from LNG imports,
gas
production in the Netherlands, and adequate
supply
of
gas
through pipelines and interconnections.
GTS
closely monitors the market and sees no direct threat to
supply
security in the current fill level.
