In that case, Dutch regulator ACM will revoke the
supplier
's license and a window period of a maximum of 20 working days will start. During that period, customers (end users) of the
supplier
concerned are proportionally divided among the other suppliers if the trustee/liquidator fails to sell the
customer
base as a whole (or fails to get the
supplier
in question back on track financially).
What does it mean for suppliers?
A
supplier
who delivers
gas
/electricity to households/consumers and whose license has been revoked, must
supply
customer
data to the Dutch TSOs for natural
gas
and power (
GTS
and TenneT) in a format determined within NEDU. The TSOs will send this data (in the same format) to the acquiring suppliers. The method of exchanging this data is currently under construction, but when the format has been established, it will be published here.
What format is the
customer
data file?
It is an Excel file. An example of the layout is shown in the file at the bottom of this page.
How does
GTS
handle
customer
data?
GTS
will of course treat these data confidentially and will use it exclusively for the purpose described above. After the files have been received by the acquiring suppliers,
GTS
will destroy all data.
Where can I find more information about this
customer
data procedure?
More information about the procedure can be found on the
TenneT
website, the Dutch TSO for (electrical) power.
