What  changes for my combustion installation per 1-1-2017?
In 2017, new legislation for emission standards come into force for existing medium-sized combustion installations which are used by industries, companies and non-residential buildings.
As from 1 January 2017, existing so called medium-sized combustion installations (> 1MW, < 50MW) have to comply to the new emission requirements. The NOx emission requirement which is iimposed  by the Government is less than 70 mg/m30 at 3% O2.
The possibilities to achieve this are:
optimization of burner settings
adjustment of the burner construction or new burner(s) and/or boilers
the application of exhaust
gas
circulation.
