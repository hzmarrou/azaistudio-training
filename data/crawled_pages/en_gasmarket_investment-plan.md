Until now,
GTS
complied with this legal provision in accordance with the Quality and
Capacity
Document (KCD / NOP). In 2018, however, national legislation (Decision 375 and MR WJZ / 18038636) included further rules for the investment plan. The handy change is the status of the document: previously the NOP / KCD was offered for information to EZK and ACM, but the IP is offered for offer. Approval of the IP therefore means approval of the investments in the approval of the described investments domestically.
Each investment plan is valid for a period of 2 years. In case of significant changes, the IP can be amended with an addendum.
The
Quality Assurance System
(Quality document) is used as the basis for the realization of part of the investment
portfolio
described in the Investment Plans.
