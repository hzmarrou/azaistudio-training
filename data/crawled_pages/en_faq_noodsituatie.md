Which regulations describe the way GTS will act in extreme situations?
In the event of extreme market conditions,
GTS
will keep the
system
balanced as long as possible by the means described in the
Transportcode
Gas
LNB
(TCG). EU Regulation
2017/1938 concerning measures to safeguard the security of
supply
of
gas
details the circumstances in which the government can declare an emergency situation. According to this Regulation, everything possible has to be done to keep
gas
available for the ‘solidarity-protected customers’. The emergency plan which is part of the Regulation is implemented in the Netherlands in the so-called
Bescherm- en Herstelplan
Gas
(
Gas
Protection and Recovery Plan)
. See the Regulation for more details.
Transportcode Gas LNB
European Regulation
Bescherm en Herstelplan Gas
Are the TTF and certain exit points (e.g. border points) excluded from the measures according to the security of supply Regulation?
No. According to the Regulation, which is described in detail in the Bescherm- en Herstelplan
Gas
(BHG), the competent authority can take all measures that are deemed appropriate to secure the
supply
of
gas
to ‘solidarity-protected’ customers. The BHG gives a merit order for certain specific measures. However, if circumstances change quickly, several measures can be introduced at the same time, or measures can be skipped. Please note that ‘solidarity’ means solidarity with other EU member states. This implies that all (neighbouring) EU member states will also have to take measures when
gas
delivery to ‘solidarity-protected customers’ is threatened in a member state.
In an emergency situation GTS can instruct shippers to change their storage nominations. How will GTS act in the event of an emergency situation?
GTS
will act in accordance with government regulations and stipulations. In the event of an emergency situation in accordance with the
TCG
,
GTS
can give instructions on entry and exit points.
GTS
will communicate these instructions via adapted confirmations (or by phone if necessary). However, if there is a shortage of
gas
, which cannot be resolved by the means described in the TSC, an emergency security of
supply
situation will be declared and the measures described in the (BHG) will be called upon. The competent authority will be the Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy.
GTS
will act according to the Minister’s orders. The Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy will act according to the Regulation, described in the Bescherm en Herstelplan
Gas
(BHG).
Will shippers’ nominations be interrupted by GTS and will GTS instruct shippers via NOMRES as to what they have to nominate? Would shippers be allowed to trade the residual volume in the market or would shippers have to hold on to it to support the SBS?
If and when shortages are expected or arise, the market-based
system
described in the TCG will be kept functioning for as long as possible.
GTS
will communicate these instructions via adapted confirmations (NOMRES or by phone if necessary). If an emergency security of
supply
of
gas
situation is declared, the competent authority will be the Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy.
GTS
will act according to the Minister’s orders. The Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy will act according to the Regulation, described in the Bescherm- en Herstelplan
Gas
.
In an emergency situation, GTS might reduce withdrawal at exit points. When supplying customers in the GTS/DSO grid, the following groups can de distinguished: GGV, GXX, G1As, G2As, non-metered GGV, non-metered GXX. Which customers can be considered as ’s
GTS
will act according to the Regulation with the aim being to keep delivery to ‘solidarity-protected customers’ secure as long as possible. In the Netherlands, these consist of the G1As, G2As and essential social services (such as hospitals).
What would the consequences be for a shipper's portfolio in relation to the shipper’s customers, assets and storages? How can shippers prepare themselves?
The best way to prepare is to have your administrative systems in good shape, so you are able to deliver correct data to the competent authorities when requested. You should also be prepared to act promptly and without discussion according to the orders of the competent authorities (whether directly or via
GTS
), for instance at your storages or other network points.
In order to reduce the impact of a potential disruption of
gas
supplies from Russia,
GTS
also advices policy makers, users of
gas
and shippers to use the possibilities at their disposal to reduce
gas
consumption, develop and utilise alternative
supply
sources and fill storages.
How does natural gas curtailment apply to my company? Does it apply to specific exit points designated by GTS (e.g.: natural gas delivery at exit point X will be 0 MW on dd/mm/yyyy) or does it apply to the total natural gas consumption of my company (e.g.
If there is an emergency situation according to the Regulation, the competent authority will be the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy and
GTS
will act according to its orders. The Minister has announced that, if the Bescherm en Herstelplan
Gas
implemented, the 60 largest industrial consumers will be instructed to reduce their consumption of
gas
to a certain minimum. This will be monitored by the energy sector regulator ACM. The 60 consumers have been informed by the Ministry. If certain consumers do not act according to the instructions, the ultimate measure could be that their connections are cut off from the grid.
When will GTS organise the natural gas tender in accordance with the Bescherm en Herstelplan Gas (BHG) plan?
The tender described in the Bescherm en Herstelplan
Gas
(BHG) has not been implemented in the
Gas
Code/national law.
Bescherm en Herstelplan Gas (BHG): how will measure #7 of the Bescherm en Herstelplan Gas (“afschakelen niet beschermde gebruikers” (“disconnection of users who are not protected”) take effect? In which order will customers be switched off?
See Q "How does natural
gas
curtailment apply to my company". The order in which customers will be instructed to reduce their
gas
consumption at particular exits will be determined by the Minister.
By how much would each Bescherm en Herstelplan Gas (BHG) measure lead to a reduction in gas consumption?
An indication of the
gas
reduction provided by each measure in the Bescherm en Herstelplan is given in table 4 of the Plan.
The Bescherm en Herstelplan Gas (BHG) makes a distinction between essential (“essentieel”) electricity production and non-essential (“niet-essentieel”) electricity production. What does that mean? What does it mean specifically for combined heat and power
This is to be decided by the Minister.
When a “dwingende aanwijzing” (“binding instruction”) is given to no longer consume natural gas, who will issue it? What legal instruments will be used?
See Q "How does natural
gas
curtailment apply to my company". The Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy is the competent authority.
When the industrial consumer for whom a shipper has booked exit capacity is switch off, what will happen to the booking, will the shipper get a refund?
The focus of the European TSOs and the competent authorities is on security of
supply
, especially for solidarity-protected consumers. For any questions relating to the working of the Bescherm en Herstelplan
Gas
(BHG) and compensation for any measure taken in the course of the emergency situation, please contact the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy.
