Many national and international parties are active in the Dutch
gas
sector, such as
gas
producers,
gas
storage operators, network operators and
gas
distribution
companies. The launch of the TTF in the Netherlands has created a major trading hub for buying or selling
gas
within the Dutch market area.
When the TTF was set up in 2003, this led to huge growth in
gas
trading in a single marketplace, significantly increasing
gas
trading liquidity. The volume of
gas
traded using the TTF as its transfer point has grown substantially in recent years and this volume is now the largest in Europe. TTF
gas
trades account for more than eighty times the volume of
gas
consumed in the Netherlands.
Gas
prices in the Dutch market area, made transparent through exchanges and data publishing agencies, have become important reference prices in Europe.
How does the TTF operate
The TTF (Title Transfer Facility) is a virtual transfer point within
GTS
’s national
gas
transport network. In other words, a network point where we offer market parties the opportunity to transfer
gas
that is already present in our
system
(‘entry-paid
gas
’) to another party. We register this trade through ‘nominations’, i.e. electronic messages stating the volume of
gas
transferred, the time period and the buyer and seller.
Although such
gas
trades are mutual business transactions between our customers, they must report transactions to us. This means we always know who owns the
gas
in our
system
.
Gas
exchange
Gas
exchanges facilitate the many parties who want to trade in
gas
on the TTF. Parties can buy or sell
gas
anonymously on the TTF via the
gas
exchange. The
gas
exchange brings together
gas
suppliers and
gas
buyers and is responsible for processing the financial transactions. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy has appointed ICE ENDEX and ECC B.V. as
gas
exchange operators for the Dutch
gas
market.
