It is in your and in our interest that we have access to the correct contact person details so that we can reach you quickly in case of an emergency. In some cases, we also send out general e-mails, such as a newsletter or a reminder to book transport

We therefore ask you for the details of the following contact persons:
Contractual: this is generally the contact person      who is our first point of contact for contractual and general matters;
Operational: this is for technical matters      regarding your contract. This is preferably a general telephone number      which is available 24/7;
Financial:      for financial matters.
It is of course possible that one person has several roles.
