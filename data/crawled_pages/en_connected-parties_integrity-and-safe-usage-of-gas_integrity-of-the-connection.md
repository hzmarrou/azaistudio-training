The
Connection
Code
Gas
-TSO state that your
gas
installation
connection
and
gas
installation must not constitute a hazard, either for personnel of the TSO or for personnel of third parties engaged by the TSO, that could disrupt the operation of the national
gas
transmission
network. Your
gas
installation
connection
and
gas
installation are considered to be sound if they meet
the conditions in chapter 2 of the Connection Code Gas -TSO
.
Two measures are referred to in these conditions that can be incorporated into your
gas
installation
connection
to guarantee its integrity. As these measures have been taken in very few
gas
installation connections up to now, there is a provision allowing you to demonstrate that your
gas
installation
connection
and
gas
installation are sound by providing a declaration by a notified body. The notified body can state in its declaration that the
gas
installation
connection
and
gas
installation located behind the transfer point comply with the relevant legislation and regulations.
Before a new
connection
is taken into operation, or in case an existing
gas
installation
connection
is taken into operation again after being out of service, the owner must demonstrate that:
the two measures referred to in      the
Connection
Code
Gas
- TSO (check  valve and equipment to prevent      oscillations in pressure have been taken, or
the
connection
and
gas
installation including cathodic protection,
gas
pressure regulating      stations, appliances running on
gas
and the buildings containing these      installations have been designed, manufactured and inspected in accordance      with the legislation and regulations applicable to this
gas
installation.
Meanwhile if you plan to make any modifications to your
gas
installation
connection
and/or
gas
installation which could affect safety or disrupt the operation of the national
gas
transmission
network, they must be reported beforehand to the
GTS
Connectiondesk (Tel.: +31 50 521 2323 or email
[email protected]
