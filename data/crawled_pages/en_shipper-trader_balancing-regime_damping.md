Below follows an explanation of what damping is, what purpose it serves and who can and/or is required to apply damping. On this page we also publish the damping formula and alpha parameter for the current
gas day
and next
gas day
.
Due to the
linepack
(buffer effect) in our network, it is possible that a change in the
gas
flow on the exit side of our network will be followed at a later moment by a damped change in the
gas
flow on the entry side of our network. This is called
damping
. This means that on an hourly basis, entry and exit are not equal (entry minus exit is not zero). The amount of damping that must be applied varies from day to day and from
hour
to
hour
and is determined by the damping formula. On a daily basis, the sum of all hourly entries and sum of all exits have to be equal (entry - exit = 0).
We suggest that shippers that apply damping in their programme on a regular basis to retrieve the damping parameter through B2B
.

Historical damping parameters
It is possible to download a historical CSV file containing the alpha parameter for the past 31 days.
To whom does damping apply?
Damping is obligatory to parties responsible for acknowledged programmes who wish to transport
gas
to small-scale users. They are expected to apply damping to their exit programmes.
Damping is optional for parties responsible for acknowledged programmes who have physical exit points in their
portfolio
. Damping cannot be applied in portfolios that only have TTF transactions and/or trading programmes.
If you want to change the status of a
portfolio
(and start or stop the application of damping), please notify us by e-mail at least 10 working days in advance.
Damping formula
This is a formula which reflects the transport characteristics of the network and which is dependent on the demand for transport. The outcome of this formula is not the same every day because it has a parameter, called alpha, which will be adjusted daily. The formula including the parameter will be published on our website at 09:00 hours on the day prior to the day of transport.

By changing the alpha parameter, the intention is to change the amount and time delay of the damping in such a way that the network is filled in a varied manner throughout the day, which fits in with the performance and possibilities of the
gas
transport
system
. This means that the amount of
linepack
(buffer) available to the market as Green Zone is maximised as much as possible.
The file “Example of Damping Formula” contains a sample calculation of the damping formula. Users can enter their own values for the exit flow and calculate the associated required entry flow. The file "Use of damping formula" contains an explanation of the formula.
