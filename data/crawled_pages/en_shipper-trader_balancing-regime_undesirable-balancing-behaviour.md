De Autoriteit Consument & Markt (ACM) has published a decision following Netbeheer Nederland's code proposal regarding amendments to the
Gas
Transport Code LNB. The objective of the code modification is to prevent undesired balancing behaviour.
For the safe transportation of
gas
, it is essential that the
gas
transport network remains balanced. This means that the transport network maintains the correct pressure and that, overall, approximately the same amount of
gas
is injected as is withdrawn. This obligation arises from the European Network Code for Balancing (NC BAL).
The decision of the Dutch Regulator ACM regarding undesirable balancing behaviour concretely outlines the necessity to minimise the balancing actions that are called for by
GTS
. The decision defines what (substantial) undesirable balancing behaviour is and what consequences are associated with it. A program responsible party will pay a financial charge of 30% of the amount of the balancing action involved in the event of undesirable balancing behaviour and the license of a program responsible party can also be revoked in the event of substantial undesirable balancing behaviour.
The code amendment will come into effect on January 1, 2024. Shippers are requested to thoroughly review
the decision
in detail. Also see the presentation about this subject that is discussed on the
Shipper
meeting in October 2023 below.
