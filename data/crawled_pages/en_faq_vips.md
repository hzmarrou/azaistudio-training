If a shipper keeps the contract on the IP, can we choose later on to move the contract to the VIP?
Yes
If a shipper chooses to keep the contract on the IP can he then still use Surrender Of Capacity, Capacity conversion, Transfer of Capacity, Transfer of Usage, Diversion and Wheeling?
Yes.  For Surrender Of
Capacity
and
Capacity
conversion the
capacity
will be offered on the VIP. If the auction is succesfull this will result in  a VIP-contract. The part of the original contract that is not auctioned successfully will remain on the IP.  For Diversion we applied for a code change to facilitate diversion from (V)IP to VIP. Transfer of Contract and Transfer of Usage rights will be available as usual, both on IP and VIP.
Wheeling
will be continued for storage-storage combinations and existing
wheeling
contracts will be respected.
Is there a material effect caused by the implematation of VIPs?
ACM conducted a consultation on the material impact of the introduction of the 5
VIPs
). Tariffs on IPs and
VIPs
are equal because of the NC TAR decision by ACM. We conclude that there is no material impact for shippers.
Are there any restrictions stemming from the hybrid model on the possibilities to nominate/confirm/allocate on the border points?
Nominations for physical flow at a specific point will continue to be checked against the usage rights, both at IPs and
VIPs
separately. Nominations made for a specific point will be confirmed and allocated on that same point. Matching with the
NNO
will be done on VIP-level. We therefore see no restrictions for contract combinations on the border as e.g..
IP for
GTS
and VIP for
NNO
VIP for
GTS
and IP for
NNO
If one
shipper
has both IP- and VIP-contracts for
GTS
and wants to match these with one counterparty at the other side of the border.
Can a shipper trade IP capacity with a Transfer of Contract or Transfer of Usage with a third party and will this capacity stay at the IP? Can the capacity be traded back tot he original owner and will it remain IP-capacity?
Transfer of
capacity
and of usage rights remains possible, both for IPs and
VIPs
. The owner of the
capacity
(the one with the
contracted capacity
) can choose wheter the
capacity
can be moved to the VIP. Once the
capacity
resides on the VIP it can not be moved back to an IP.
Can a shipper increase the capacity on an IP-contract for use with a gas contract that has an IP as its delivery point?
No. As soon as the IP is part of a VIP all
available capacity
will be offered on the VIP. This is an explicit consequence of NC CAM.
Can a shipper move a part of the contract to the VIP?
In the questionaire we use currently we ask to make a choice for the contract as a whole. Later on you can move part of the contract at an IP to the VIP e.g. for a Transfer of
Capacity
.
Did GTS inform the NNOs regarding the intention to use a hybrid model?
Yes
Do you see a risc that the EC and/or ACER will demand a different implementation of VIPs?
With the hybrid model we offer maximum flexibility to the shippers. As indicated, NC CAM does not contain explicit terms what to do with existing contracts. We did not receive signals that EC or ACER will enforce the VIP-only model. As far as we know Austria already implemented this model. In Germany the dual model was chosen. We conclude that different models are implemented already throughout Europe.
If I have a Transfer of Usage (ToU) or Transfer of Capacity (ToC), do I have a free choice for iP or VIP?
For Transfer of
Capacity
(ToC) the choice you make for the contract you have with
GTS
is not dependant on the choice that the original owner of the
capacity
makes for his residue of the contract. If you are the owner of transferred
capacity
, you can decide.
If you have a Transfer of Usage (ToU) contract, you are from our point of view not the owner. The network point related to the ToU should be the same as the network point for the original contract. You should get in contact with the owner of the original contract (the one who transferred the rights to you), in the end he will decide.
What is the advantage of moving my IP contract to a VIP?
If you want to book additional
capacity
on the IP it will be auctioned at the VIP. Your additional
capacity
is than in fact registered on the VIP. So if you want all
capacity
together the VIP is the point to use! Be advised that when we calculate your
exceedings
,
we will compare your usage right per
portfolio
and per network point with your allocation on that point. The IP and the VIP will be separate points in that comparison.
