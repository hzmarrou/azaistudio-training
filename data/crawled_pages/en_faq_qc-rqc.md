What is the Subdivision of G-gas and H-gas
The
GTS
transport
system
contains two physically separate networks that are linked together by blending stations. There is a low-calorific
system
intended to
supply
exits with G-
gas
or L-
gas
and an high-calorific
system
for H-
gas
exits.
Most entries are linked directly to the G-
gas
or H-
gas
system
. However, some entries lie between G-
gas
and H-
gas
in terms of quality. They are incorporated into the G-
gas
or H-
gas
system
via
QC
or
RQC
.
What is QC?
High-quality gases are converted into lower-quality gases by means of a process called
QC
(Quality Conversion)
.
The G-
gas
system
regularly experiences entry shortages, while there is a surplus of gases with a higher Wobbe ( H-
gas
). The surplus H-
gas
is converted into G-
gas
(
QC
) via blending stations. The amount of
QC
(converted H-
gas
) will be shown via the ‘
QC
-meter’ on the
QC/RQC dashboard
. If there is little
QC
, then the H-
gas
can be blended at no cost with other gases into  G-
gas quality
(this is called enrichment). If a large amount of H-
gas
has to be converted, then it must be converted into G-
gas
by adding  nitrogen (this
gas
is called ‘pseudo G-
gas
’).
When nitrogen is used, the
gas
transport network must be controlled in such a way that the H-gases with the lowest Wobbes are the first to be transported to the blending stations. This gives the greatest
capacity
for conversion at the lowest costs.
The amount of nitrogen available and the level of its use are shown on this dashboard via the Nitrogen meter on the
QC
/
RQC
dashboard. This means that the maximum
QC
limits can be clearly distinguished by the amount of nitrogen not yet used. See more detailed information at the
Nitrogen report
.
Part of the nitrogen may be delivered out of a nitrogen storage. The ‘N2-storage meter’ on the
QC
/
RQC
dashboard shows the actual volume available of this storage.
What is RQC?
The process of converting low-quality gases into higher-quality gases (H-
gas
) is called
RQC
(Reverse Quality Conversion).
Sometimes the
gas
transport
system
has a shortage of H-
gas
entries and a surplus of gases with a lower Wobbe. The surplus low-Wobbe gases are added to the H-
gas
via blending stations.
It is impossible to indicate the
RQC
capacity
in advance, as it depends on the current qualities of all gases. The
RQC
capacity
can be between 0 m3(n)/h and approximately 1,5 mln. m3(n)/h. The amount of use  of
RQC
will be shown by the ‘
RQC
-meter’ on the
QC
/
RQC
dashboard.
As already indicated, many entries lie between G-
gas
and H-
gas
in terms of quality. In general, the
QC
need is high, so all these gases are converted into G-
gas
by means of
QC
. But if the
QC
need decreases  continuously, then gradually more of these gases will be converted to H-
gas
by means of
RQC
. At the borderline, both
RQC
and
QC
take place simultaneously. It is assumed by definition that the total transport
system
is in
RQC
mode if the amount of converted
RQC
gas
exceeds the amount of converted
QC
gas
.
How up-to-date is the data displayed on the QC/RQC Dashboard?
About 20 minutes after every
hour
the information of that
hour
becomes available.The ‘meters’ show the status of the last available
hour
. The graphs and reports show the hourly data updated to include the last available
hour
. The daily, monthly and yearly aggregations contain data up to and including the last complete
gas day
.
Which ‘meter’ is displayed on the home page?
One of the meters on the
QC
/
RQC
dashboard is the most important, depending on the current
QC
/
RQC
status. The current status is displayed below the meters on the dashboard. The most important meter is displayed on the home page of the
GTS
website.
If the
gas
transport
system
is using nitrogen for
QC
, then the Nitrogen meter is important and will be displayed on the home page. If no nitrogen is used but the transport
system
is still in
QC
-mode than the ‘
QC
-meter’ will be displayed. If the transport
system
is in
RQC
-mode than the ‘
RQC
-meter’ will be displayed.
