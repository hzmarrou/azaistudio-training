To provide our customers with the best possible support, we have set up two points of contact: the
Customer Desk
for shippers and the Connections Desk for Industry and Local
Distribution
Companies (LDCs).
Please check our
contact page
for more information such as opening hours.
These points of contact are set up specifically for
GTS
customers. For questions about residential connections, please contact your local
distribution
company or your own
gas
supplier
.This also applies to any questions about corrections to calorific values as shown on your energy bill. The main reason for this is that we don't have adequate information on how the regional transport network is configured nor what kind of natural
gas
is delivered to a specific address.
You can find more background information about your energy bill on the site
www.consuwijzer.nl
. This will also tell you which Local
Distribution
Company is active in your region.
