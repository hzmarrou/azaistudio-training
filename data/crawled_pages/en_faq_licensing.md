Can I get my licence before I am ready to do business and want to use it?
You can get a licence before you use our services. There is no requirement to use the licence as soon as you get it. Nor will the licence run out.
How much does it cost to get a licence?
There are no costs associated with obtaining a licence and we will not send you a bill. Of course, you will have to bear the costs of any measures you have to take to meet the conditions for obtaining a licence.
If I want to transport gas to an industry, do I need an LB licence?
No
Why do I have to provide a copy of my ID card?
Because Gasunie has a legitimate interest in protecting the market and itself against future attempts of fraud. Therefore, effective verification of a person’s identity has to take place in which we want to assure that the person actually is the person that he or she says to be. Of all potential new customers a copy of a valid ID card will be requested, but make sure that the picture and national identification number are not visible. You can use the ‘KopieID’ app from the Dutch Government to provide the copy without the photo and national identification service number, but you can also do this yourself. Gasunie will not accept copies of an ID card where the photo and a national identification number are visible!
GTS
will store the copy of the ID-card until one year after the licence is withdrawn. The request complies with the rules of the GDPR. If you have any questions or remarks concerning our request please contact
