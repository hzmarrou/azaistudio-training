network.
Separate from the fact that the

connection
concerned,

regards this CDS contracting as a matter for the shippers and knows that there are no checks on this between
GTS
and the private network operators.
CDS network points are booked on a first come first served basis (FCFS).
GTS
offers the 5 standard
capacity
products on this basis: Yearly, Quarterly, Monthly, Day and Within Day.
