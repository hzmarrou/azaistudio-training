To determine the calorific value, the
gas
composition is determined with the aid of a
gas
chromatograph at representative points in the
GTS
transport
system
.
Not every
gas
delivery station has its own
gas
chromatograph. In some cases, one
gas
chromatograph can serve as many as a hundred
gas
delivery stations. The
gas quality
system
process description specifies how the calorific value (
gas quality
) is determined at the transfer points. This document is the description according to articles 2.4.6, 3.2.2 and 3.5.2 of the Metering Code

LNB. The table below shows the daily average calorific values for the regional network points over the past 7 days. This page is updated every day.
The
user
must check for himself whether the above information is suitable for the purpose for which this information is used.
GTS
is of the opinion that this information cannot be used for:
(On-line) process control, because it concerns a daily average value that is at least one day old. Quality fluctuations can occur on a short time scale.
Determining the energy flow for contract monitoring, because this monitoring must take place on an hourly basis.
GTS
provides online information for these purposes.
Control by private end users of their energy
supplier
's energy bill. The calorific settlement that is used depends, among other things, on the structure of the regional
network operator
and the composition of the various categories of customers. For further information on this subject, we also refer to the Consuwijzer (www.consuwijzer.nl).
