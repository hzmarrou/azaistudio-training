As of 2020 the tariff structure is based on the principles of the ‘Network code on harmonized
transmission
tariff structures for
gas
’ (NC-TAR), decided by the European Commission.
Based on these principles the Dutch regulator ACM has decided that starting 2020 there will be an uniform all in tariff for all network points (the so called post stamp methodology). Within this structure there will be only a difference between entry-storage, entry-non-storage, exit-storage and exit-non-storage. For these purpose four year reserve prices are determined. ACM then used these tariffs to calculate the reserve prices for the 5 possible
capacity
products (year, quarter, month, day and within-day). In this calculation the seasonal factors and multipliers are used. You can find all reserve prices in Appendix 1 of the
TSC
.
Capacity
can only be contracted  for periods according to the above mentioned products year, quarter, month, day and within-day. A desired booking that differs form the duration of these products, must be split into several bookings to cover the desired period. Also a desired profiled booking must be split into several bookings.
A yearly product can start at every desired month, a quarterly product only at January 1
st
, April 1
st
, July 1
st
or October 1
st
. It is however possible to book a yearly, quarterly or monthly product after the start of the desired period, for yearly and quarterly this is only possible in the first month of the desired period. For the days before the desired start date of the booking we will then book
capacity
ZERO.
Capacity
products type year, quarter and month will always end at the last day of the (last) month of that product.
At the shippers request,
GTS
can retrospectively optimize a combination of contracted quarterly, monthly and/or daily
capacity
products to the cheapest combination. Such a request from the
shipper
will only be granted if the bookings have been made on the same day, for the same network point and, of course, in the same direction. For this purpose,
GTS
offers two calculation tools (one for a profiled booking and one for a non-profiled booking) to be used by shippers to determine in advance the optimized combination of the bookings (and the costs) to be made.

Below you can find an example of a profiled booking and the optimization that can be made.Desired profile:
This can be optimized:
Therefore this results in 5 separate bookings: 1 yearly booking, a quarterly booking for Q1, a quarterly booking for Q4, a monthly booking for January and a monthly booking for December.
Exceeding
Capacity
A
capacity
overshoot, for which a surcharge is applicable and effected, occurs when per day the contractual
entry capacity
and/or
exit capacity
is exceeded by more than the operational margin of 2% per
hour
. Only the highest
capacity
overshoot per
gas day
will be charged.
If the entry and / or
exit capacity
contracted per
gas day
at the
GTS
network point is exceeded, this will lead to a
capacity
overshoot.
GTS
charges a tariff for this to the
network user
. Only the highest
capacity
excess is charged per
gas day
.
The rate for the excess is equal to the rate for a monthly
capacity
product associated with the month in which the excess occurs.
The amount due for an excess consists of the difference between the booked
capacity
(sum of the usage rights per
hour
per
gas day
) and the actually used
capacity
(the offline allocation value), which is multiplied by the rate for the corresponding monthly
capacity
product.
FAQ
Where can I find information on tariffs.
Tariffs are part of the
TSC
tariff appendix.
How can the monthly cost be calculated for Yearly product?
The cost per month for Yearly product can be calculated as follows: cost (Euro) = booked
capacity
* reserve price * number of days in month / number of days in year (= 365 or 366). The reserve prices depend on entry/exit and storage/non-storage and can be found in Appendix 1 of our
TSC
How can the monthly cost be calculated for Quarterly product?
The cost per month for Quarterly product can be calculated as follows: cost (Euro) = booked
capacity
* reserve price * number of days in month / number of days in quarter (= 90, 91 or 92). The reserve prices depend on entry/exit and storage/non-storage and can be found in Appendix 1 of our
TSC
.
How can the monthly cost be calculated for Monthly product?
The cost per month for Monthly product can be calculated as follows: cost (Euro) = booked
capacity
* reserve price. The reserve prices depend on entry/exit and storage/non-storage and can be found in Appendix 1 of our TSC.
How can the cost be calculated for Day product?
The cost for Day product can be calculated as follows: Cost (Euro) = booked
capacity
* reserve price. The reserve prices depend on firm/
interruptible
, entry/exit and storage/non-storage and can be found in Appendix 1 of our TSC.
How can the cost be calculated for Within-Day product?
The cost for Within-Day product can be calculated as follows: Cost (Euro) = booked
capacity
* reserve price * number of hours booked / number of hours in day (= 23, 24 or 25). The reserve prices depend on entry/exit and storage/non-storage and can be found in Appendix 1 of our
TSC
