Connection agreement
What does it cost to terminate the connection?
There is no charge for terminating the
connection
but you do have to bear in mind the 3-month notice period. Your contractual obligations remain in force until the actual termination date.
Any
contracted capacity
cannot unfortunately be cancelled, except in the case of bankruptcy or business cessation, when contractual obligations arising from booked
capacity
are also terminated. 50% of the tariff of the remaining booking will be charged to the holder of the
capacity
for that.
Which articles apply to the termination of a connection?
Article 16 of the General Conditions for
Connection
Agreements, version 3.1 accompanying the
connection agreement
describe the conditions under which termination is possible.
In addition, article 6.A.11 of the TSC deals with the
supply
of
transmission capacity
in the event of bankruptcy or business cessation.

Balancering regime
I will only trade on the TTF and so I assume that I will always be in balance. Is the balancing regime applicable to me in this case?
Yes, traders also need to be informed about the balancing regime and needs to be able to receive and send all the related messages.
Although, fundamentally, a trader will not experience imbalances quickly, it may be the case that an imbalance occurs between entry and exit in the
portfolio
, e.g. due to incorrect
portfolio
management or an error in the nominations/confirmations with counterparties.
How can I become an offeror on the gas exchange of ICE Endex?
If you want to become an offeror on the
gas
exchange you must satisfy a number of requirements. Click
here
for the website of ICE Endex. If you can trade on the exchange of ICE Endex that is sufficient to offer flexibility to the
gas
exchange in the run-up to a balancing action.
GTS
does not propose any additional requirements.

Capacity
-
Connected party
Capacity
It is important that both minimum and maximum
capacity
are known. The maximum
capacity
is given in normal cubic metres per
hour
at a temperature of 0°C and a pressure of 1013 mbar and with an energy content Hs of 35,17 MJ/m3. The maximum
capacity
is a determining factor for the design and dimensions of the
connection point
. We need the minimum
capacity
in conjunction with the off-take pattern in order to verify the
measuring equipment
provided by connected parties.
The off-take pattern raises questions about anticipated use. For example, connected parties may consume more
gas
in the winter for space heating, so a summer/winter pattern is involved here. Sometimes there is also a continuous (low) basic off-take with regular peaks that are a multiple of the basic off-take.
In brief, the off-take pattern indicates how connected parties’ installations are operated and provides insight into the possible fluctuations in
gas
consumption between minimum and maximum
capacity
.

Capacity
conversion
Can I convert unbundled capacity contracted at an interconnection point (other than a VIP) directly to bundled capacity at the parent VIP?
Yes, this is possible. It is not necessary to first transfer the unbundled
capacity
(through the VIP transfer service) to the VIP. You can indicate during your auction bid on PRISMA the amount of unbundled
capacity
you wish to convert and the contract number (“BookingID”)that can be reduced by the same amount.

Certificaten
What is a digital certificate?
As well as providing certainty about the identity of the owner, certificates offer the possibility of encryption. Encryption and integrity are key prerequisites for secure internet communication. There are many ways to encrypt and secure files. However, in practice, the public and private key method has proved the most reliable. This method uses two keys, a public and a private key. The sender encrypts the messages using the recipient’s public key. To render the message legible again, the recipient decrypts it using his private key. This happens automatically for communication with
GTS
. Put simply, a certificate ensures that through a combination of a
user
name and a password, you can log in on secure parts of the
GTS
website.
How long is my certificate valid?
A certificate is valid for three years.

Communicatie test
What is the lead time for a communication test?
The lead time depends on a number of factors. If your IT
system
is suitable for electronic messaging or if you use a service provider who is familiar with
GTS
, then it will usually be possible to complete the process within a few weeks. The time required will also depend on how quickly staff respond and their availability. You should allow for a lead time of at least four weeks.

Emission standard
What  changes for my combustion installation per 1-1-2017?
In 2017, new legislation for emission standards come into force for existing medium-sized combustion installations which are used by industries, companies and non-residential buildings.
As from 1 January 2017, existing so called medium-sized combustion installations (> 1MW, < 50MW) have to comply to the new emission requirements. The NOx emission requirement which is iimposed  by the Government is less than 70 mg/m30 at 3% O2.
The possibilities to achieve this are:
optimization of burner settings
adjustment of the burner construction or new burner(s) and/or boilers
the application of exhaust
gas
circulation.

Gas Quality
Gas quality
Two qualities of
gas
are transported in
GTS
’s
transmission
grid, i.e. H-
gas
(high-calorific
gas
) and G-
gas
(low-calorific or Groningen
gas
). An important measure for
gas quality
is the
Wobbe index
. The
"Regeling gaskwaliteit"
contains the Wobbe ranges.
You can indicate a preference for H-
gas
or G-
gas
on the "
Application form new connection
". Whether the preference indicated by a
connected party
can be honoured depends on the proximity of an H-
gas
or G-
gas
pipeline and the
available capacity
in the H- or G-
gas
system
.
Pressure
The
connected party
can state the desired pressure or pre-pressure at the
connection point
in bar (o). The
gas
transmission
grid has two networks, the RTL (regional
transmission
line) and the HTL (high-pressure
transmission
line). The RTL has a maximum pressure of 40 bar(o) and the HTL a maximum pressure of 67 or 80 bar(o). The effective pressure at the
connection point
is dependent on the distance from a compressor station or a metering and pressure-regulating station. The RTL network has a minimum pressure of ca. 8 bar(o) and the HTL network a minimum pressure of ca. 40 bar(o). If possible, we will take account of the desired pressure put forward by a
connected party
.

Implementation netwerkcode
Has GTS implemented the provisions of the daily imbalance charge calculation methodology (BAL NC art. 20)?
Yes, although you do not receive an invoice for the daily imbalance charge, we have.Article 21(2) of BAL NC states that the daily imbalance quantity calculation shall be adapted accordingly where a
linepack
flexibility service is offered;
GTS
offers such a service (and where you do get an invoice for) in such a way that the outcome of the calculation for the daily imbalance quantity is always zero. As that is the case, the daily imbalance charge is consequently also always zero. Obviously we will not send you an invoice for that.
Because we understand that it is still important to maintain an incentive on the network users to be in balance at the end of the
gas day
, we implemented a
Linepack Flexibility Service
, for which you do receive an invoice every month.
Do you calculate a daily imbalance quantity for each network user’s balancing portfolio for each gas day according to art. 21?
Yes, we do, and as explained in [the question before]  we know it is zero.

Creditworthiness
Can I get my financial security back?
Yes, you can ask us to return all or part of your additional securities if you expect that you will no longer need the additional credit. The financial securities must be valid for at least 4 months after the
end date
of the longest
transmission
booking contract. If, for example, a
transmission
contract has expired, surplus unused credit becomes available. Your credit limit must at least cover your exposure but we advise you to keep a minimum of 15% of your credit limit as surplus unused credit.
My organization features a “warehouse arrangement” (in Dutch: entrepot-regeling). Do I have to take VAT into account when determining my exposure and credit limit?
No, in case your organization features a valid “warehouse arrangement”, VAT can be excluded when calculating your exposure and related credit limit.

My organisation has a license L (EWEX), what are the consequences of the amended policy for my organisation?
The amended creditworthiness policy is also applicable for your organization. When determining your exposure, you need to take into account a 21% VAT. Besides, the financial security must be 4 months longer than the contract with an
end date
which is located furthest in the future. The
EWEX

Factor
Are the characteristics from the original booking retained if a TOC is carried out?
The product type, duration and  tariff related to the original booking will continue to apply to both the selling and the receiving party.
For example:
Shipper
A has a
capacity
booking for which the annual tariff applies. He transfers (TOC) one Quarter to another party (
shipper
B). For both bookings the annual tariff applies. The buyer (
shipper
B) will receive three invoices (one per month) based on the annual tariff,
not
the quarterly tariff.

Noodsituatie
Which regulations describe the way GTS will act in extreme situations?
In the event of extreme market conditions,
GTS
will keep the
system
balanced as long as possible by the means described in the
Transportcode
Gas
LNB
(TCG). EU Regulation
2017/1938 concerning measures to safeguard the security of
supply
of
gas
details the circumstances in which the government can declare an emergency situation. According to this Regulation, everything possible has to be done to keep
gas
available for the ‘solidarity-protected customers’. The emergency plan which is part of the Regulation is implemented in the Netherlands in the so-called
Bescherm- en Herstelplan
Gas
(
Gas
Protection and Recovery Plan)
. See the Regulation for more details.
Transportcode Gas LNB
European Regulation
Bescherm en Herstelplan Gas
Are the TTF and certain exit points (e.g. border points) excluded from the measures according to the security of supply Regulation?
No. According to the Regulation, which is described in detail in the Bescherm- en Herstelplan
Gas
(BHG), the competent authority can take all measures that are deemed appropriate to secure the
supply
of
gas
to ‘solidarity-protected’ customers. The BHG gives a merit order for certain specific measures. However, if circumstances change quickly, several measures can be introduced at the same time, or measures can be skipped. Please note that ‘solidarity’ means solidarity with other EU member states. This implies that all (neighbouring) EU member states will also have to take measures when
gas
delivery to ‘solidarity-protected customers’ is threatened in a member state.

POS
When is my POS reset?
In principle, your POS is never reset. Settlements having an effect on the POS are WDBA’s. It is only when a WDBA is performed that volumes are set off pro rata against the positions (POSs) of the causers. Shippers with a position opposite to the SBS at the time of the balancing action are not affected.
Is the POS available at hh:15 (DPM M&A, chapter 2) really going to be published later at hh:20 (DPM M&A, paragraph 3.12)?
The accountable POS will, apart from in exceptional situations, indeed be published between xx:15 and xx:20. The reason for this is that the near real-time allocations of the CSS are only available at xx:13. This is because actual near real-time allocations are used for determining the accountable POS and not the allocation from a previous
hour
as was the case for the determining the forecast POS.

QC
/
RQC
What is the Subdivision of G-gas and H-gas
The
GTS
transport
system
contains two physically separate networks that are linked together by blending stations. There is a low-calorific
system
intended to
supply
exits with G-
gas
or L-
gas
and an high-calorific
system
for H-
gas
exits.
Most entries are linked directly to the G-
gas
or H-
gas
system
. However, some entries lie between G-
gas
and H-
gas
in terms of quality. They are incorporated into the G-
gas
or H-
gas
system
via
QC
or
RQC
.
What is QC?
High-quality gases are converted into lower-quality gases by means of a process called
QC
(Quality Conversion)
.
The G-
gas
system
regularly experiences entry shortages, while there is a surplus of gases with a higher Wobbe ( H-
gas
). The surplus H-
gas
is converted into G-
gas
(
QC
) via blending stations. The amount of
QC
(converted H-
gas
) will be shown via the ‘
QC
-meter’ on the
QC/RQC dashboard
. If there is little
QC
, then the H-
gas
can be blended at no cost with other gases into  G-
gas quality
(this is called enrichment). If a large amount of H-
gas
has to be converted, then it must be converted into G-
gas
by adding  nitrogen (this
gas
is called ‘pseudo G-
gas
’).
When nitrogen is used, the
gas
transport network must be controlled in such a way that the H-gases with the lowest Wobbes are the first to be transported to the blending stations. This gives the greatest
capacity
for conversion at the lowest costs.
The amount of nitrogen available and the level of its use are shown on this dashboard via the Nitrogen meter on the
QC
/
RQC
dashboard. This means that the maximum
QC
limits can be clearly distinguished by the amount of nitrogen not yet used. See more detailed information at the
Nitrogen report
.
Part of the nitrogen may be delivered out of a nitrogen storage. The ‘N2-storage meter’ on the
QC
/
RQC
dashboard shows the actual volume available of this storage.

SBS
Do you have a forecast for the SBS over a longer period of time?
No,
GTS
has only a prognosis value for the coming
hour
.
If the zones are profiled within the gas day answer, can we then also retrieve the profile by means of a report? The SBS report only gives the zones for 1 hour, and the DPM Information exchange does not give any further report of the publication of the zo
Yes, a separate download has been provided for the zones (which indicates zones for one or more
gas
days). It is correct that in the SBS download, this zone info only shows the applicable zone. The specs for the separate zone message are given under the message specifications on the website (GTS_InformationServices_R1).

Tariefinformatie
Where can I find information on tariffs.
Tariffs are part of the
TSC
tariff appendix.
How can the monthly cost be calculated for Yearly product?
The cost per month for Yearly product can be calculated as follows: cost (Euro) = booked
capacity
* reserve price * number of days in month / number of days in year (= 365 or 366). The reserve prices depend on entry/exit and storage/non-storage and can be found in Appendix 1 of our
TSC

Temperatuurverlaging
GOS
How is the setting of the outgoing temperature at gas receiving stations done and what savings does it provide?
Setting the outgoing temperature at a
gas
receiving station takes place as follows:
- The incoming
gas
is heated in a heat exchanger isobaric and adiabatic (at the same pressure and without heat exchange with the environment) to a certain temperature;
- The pressure of the
gas
is reduced with a regulator, whereby the
gas
temperature also drops. The pressure of the
gas
is reduced with a regulator, whereby the
gas
temperature is also lowered.
- The outgoing
gas
thus reaches the desired output pressure and temperature.
The process is shown schematically below:
In the above example, the inlet pressure and temperature are 40 barg and 10 °C respectively. Assuming G-
gas
, the enthalpy at that point is -18.4737 kJ/kg (with 0 °C and 0 bar as the reference situation with an enthalpy of zero).
At an exit temperature of 5°C and a pressure of 8 bar, the enthalpy of the
gas
is increased to 1.9549 kJ/kg. Because the expansion in the regulator is isenthalpic, the enthalpy between the heat exchanger and the regulator has also been 1.9549. It can then be calculated that at a pressure of 40 barg, the temperature at that point must have been 19.37 °C.
If we assume a flow rate of 1000 m3(n)/h, the mass flow through the street is 833.4 kg/h. The amount of heat to be delivered by the heat exchanger is then
833.4 x (1.9549 - -18.4737) = 17025 kJ/h.
The same can now be done for a situation in which the outgoing
gas
temperature is lowered to 3 °C. This is shown in the figure below.
It can be seen that the enthalpy of the outgoing
gas
has been reduced to -3.8576 kJ/kg, where a temperature of 16.70 °C belongs to a pressure of 40 barg (after the heat exchanger).
In this case, the heat supplied by the heat exchanger is therefore
833.4 x (-3.8576 - -18.4737) = 12181 kJ/h.
The difference between the set output temperatures of 5 and 2 °C therefore results in an energy saving of 17025 - 12181 kJ/h = 4844 kJ/h, or approx. 28.5%. In practice savings of 5% per degree Celsius are measured.
At what minimum gas temperature should the gas be delivered?
The MR
gas quality
prescribes a minimum
gas
temperature of 0°C.
GTS
therefore always delivers the
gas
warmer than 0°C.

Safety
Gas
delivery station
How do I show that my gas installation connection and gas installation comply with the legislation and regulations?
You must be able to show that the installation has been designed, manufactured and inspected according to the legislation and regulations applicable to this installation. You must be able to show that the installation has been maintained and inspected according to the applicable legislation and regulations throughout its use.
See "
Standards applicable to industrial installations
" and "Overview of European standards and developments in standards" for a full summary of the relevant guidelines and standards.
How can I determine the integrity of the gas pipelines?
New
gas
pipelines
Gas
pipelines designed for a pressure of >500mbar must be constructed according to the Pressure Equipment Directive. According to this directive, the design of a
gas
pipeline must be checked by an organisation designated for this purpose by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment (Notified Body, NoBo for short). The manufacturer or assembler should draw up an EU Declaration of Conformity for the product or combination of products supplied, as specified in the Pressure Equipment Directive.
Existing
gas
pipelines
The requirements applicable to using
gas
pipelines in a safe and environmentally-friendly manner are based on the Dutch Environmental Management Act. The act applies to organisations obliged to hold a permit and subject to disclosure obligations, however residential buildings are also covered. This is regulated in the Dutch Activities Decree Environmental Management (Decree providing general regulations for environmental management facilities (BARIM)).
The Dutch Activities Decree Environmental Management specifies that
gas
pipeline installations should be inspected periodically (once every 4 years). Depending on the pressure and diameter of the pipelines concerned, this may be performed by a company certified by the Foundation for Certification, Inspection and Maintenance of Combustion Plants (SCIOS), scope 7B or must be performed by a NoBo (
www.scios.nl)
. Providing details of the exact boundaries between both working areas is beyond the scope of these FAQ, you should therefore consult your installer or inspection body for precise information.

Shift of
Capacity
So a shift of capacity is also a diversion?
Yes, but a shift of
capacity
does not involve fixed combinations at the same location but a combination which does not yet exist and an additional tariff based on distance.

VIPs
If a shipper keeps the contract on the IP, can we choose later on to move the contract to the VIP?
Yes
If a shipper chooses to keep the contract on the IP can he then still use Surrender Of Capacity, Capacity conversion, Transfer of Capacity, Transfer of Usage, Diversion and Wheeling?
Yes.  For Surrender Of
Capacity
and
Capacity
conversion the
capacity
will be offered on the VIP. If the auction is succesfull this will result in  a VIP-contract. The part of the original contract that is not auctioned successfully will remain on the IP.  For Diversion we applied for a code change to facilitate diversion from (V)IP to VIP. Transfer of Contract and Transfer of Usage rights will be available as usual, both on IP and VIP.
Wheeling
will be continued for storage-storage combinations and existing
wheeling
contracts will be respected.

WDBA
How often is a "Within-Day-Balancing Action '(WDBA) performed?
It is impossible to estimate in advance. We look 10 minutes and 15 minutes past the
hour
to the end of
hour
prediction of the SBS. If the prediction of the SBS at 10 minutes past the
hour
gives a reason to a WDBA, then an announcement is made in Gasport and a Request For Quote (RFQ) is placed on the trading screen of the ICE Endex. The announcement and the RFQ is an estimate of the volume and product placed on the within-day market of ICE Endex and is based on the latest information.
If the prediction of the SBS at 15 minutes past the
hour
still gives a reason to a WDBA, then an update of the announcement is made and again a Request For Quote (RFQ) is placed on the trading screen of ICE Endex.
If the prediction of the SBS for the next
hour
at 20 minutes past the
hour
gives a reason for a WBDA than an order is placed on the within-day market of ICE Endex.
The type of product for which the order is placed, is dependent on the color of the zone wherein the SBS is predicted. In the
light green zone
GTS
send an order for a WD product to the exchange with a lead time of 3 hours and 40 minutes with supplies for the remaining hours of the
gas day
. As an indication, an order that leads to a transaction at 12:20 will be delivered from 16:00 to 06:00. In the orange and
red zone
GTS
send an order for a Next-
Hour
product with a lead time of 40 minutes. The whole delivery takes place in one clock
hour
. An order for a Next
Hour
product that leads to a transaction at 12:20 has a delivery from 13:00 to 14:00.
How much gas does GTS call up when placing a WDBA?
The volume that must be called will be calculated as follows:
Difference between the anticipated final value of the SBS and the boundary value of the
dark green zone
.
The part that possibly is not yet delivered of a realized WDBA transaction is included in the determination of the volume of any new WDBA. This only applies for WDBA with the SBS in the light green area.
If the SBS is in the light-green zone, and the imbalance is less than the unbalance of the previous
hour
, no WDBA will take place.
