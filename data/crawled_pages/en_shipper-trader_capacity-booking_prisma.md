In accordance with the requirements of the European Network Code on
Capacity
Allocation Mechanisms (CAM NC),
GTS
offers
transmission capacity
through PRISMA, the joint
capacity
booking platform of the major European network operators.
The CAM NC prescribes five standard
capacity
products to be offered by the European TSO’s at the cross-border (virtual) interconnection points. These products are:
Annual
capacity
(
gas
years)
Quarterly
capacity
Monthly
capacity
Daily
capacity
:
- Day Ahead (DA, next
gas
day)
capacity
- Within Day (WD, same
gas day
)
capacity
These
capacity
products are auctioned according to a pre-published
auction calendar
set by
ENTSOG
.
Capacity
products for the monthly, quarterly and annual auction are published on the
PRISMA
website prior to each auction.
For each type of product, PRISMA determines, based on the amount of
capacity
offered by the TSOs, how much
capacity
will be offered as bundled or unbundled
capacity
. Firm capacities on both sides of the border are bundled to the maximum. The remaining
capacity
, which cannot be bundled, is offered as unbundled
capacity
. Unbundled
capacity
is offered in a separate auction that runs parallel to the bundled
capacity
auction.
DA and WD
capacity
is offered every day (including weekends and public holidays). WD
capacity
consists of the remaining
firm capacity
of the DA auctions on PRISMA.
The first WD bidding round starts at the previous
gas day
at 7:00PM (LET). This auction will remain open for 7.5 hours until 2:30AM (LET). The following auctions start on the
hour
and remain open for 30 minutes. The
capacity
of a successful bid can be used from 3.5 hours after the close of the WD auction.
After the auction has closed, the
shipper
can submit nominations to
GTS
for this acquired
capacity
from 10 minutes after the auction has closed. For the first WD auction the
shipper
can therefore nominate from 2:40AM (LET).
The WD
capacity
tariff is based on the daily
capacity
tariff and a WD factor. This factor is determined by the number of hours the
capacity
is available: WD factor = number of hours/24.
Interruptible capacity
, transfers of
capacity
and Surrender of
Capacity
(SoC) are not supported in combination with the WD
capacity
product.
An overview of all (virtual) interconnection points where
capacity
is offered through PRISMA auctions can be found in the
TSC
(Appendix 1 Network Points and Prices).
Auctions and creditworthiness If you make a bid during an auction, it will be checked, among other things, whether your credit space is sufficient to be able to purchase the desired
capacity
. It is therefore important that you ensure that you have sufficient credit space prior to the auction(s) concerned. If you have any questions about this, please contact the
GTS
Customer Desk
. More information on creditworthiness can be found
here
.
More information about the auction process can be found in the aforementioned CAM NC as
published by ENTSO-G.
