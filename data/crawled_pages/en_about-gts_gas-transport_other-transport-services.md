GTS
offers its customers the opportunity to sell the services they have purchased from
GTS
to other shippers (trading services).
This may involve on-selling the day-to-day use of a certain amount of entry and
exit capacity
.
GTS
must register these transfers so it knows where to send invoices.
Customers may also relocate the
supply
of
gas
at a specific
entry point
to an
exit point
in the same location (
wheeling
). It is also possible to transfer contracted entry and
exit capacity
to a nearby entry or
exit point
(diversion).
It can be difficult for a
customer
to determine in advance the
capacity
it may require when starting up or expanding an industrial business.  In such cases, customers may use the commissioning service and submit an estimate in the first instance. Four months later the definitive booking for these months will be established, based on the capacities that have been realized.
