‘
Wheeling
’ means that
gas
can be transported from an
entry point
to an
exit point
very close by, if the points have the same
gas quality
, at a tariff that is lower than the sum of the regular transport tariffs for the separate points.
This is possible because no physical demand is placed on the transport network. In addition,
wheeling
should have no consequences for the
capacity
quantity to be offered at auction.
