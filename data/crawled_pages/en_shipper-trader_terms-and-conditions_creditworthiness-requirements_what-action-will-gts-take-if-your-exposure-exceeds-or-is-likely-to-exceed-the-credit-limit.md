GTS
monitors hourly whether the exposure referred to in article B1.5 of the
Transmission
Code

TSO exceeds, or is likely to exceed, the credit limit.
If
GTS
indicates that exposure is likely to exceed the credit limit due to a short POS position, the party concerned is requested to adjust its exposure so that it remains within its credit limit by either adjusting its POS to zero, providing additional securities, paying its invoices or a combination of these.
Based on article 2.13.1 of the TSC,
GTS
may suspend TTF registration if a
shipper
has a short POS and has exceeded the credit limit or
GTS
has reasonable doubt that payment will be on time.
If at any time exposure exceeds the credit limit, the party concerned must immediately provide
GTS
with additional financial security under article B1.10 paragraph 2 of the
