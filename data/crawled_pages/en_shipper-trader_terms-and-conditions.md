These web pages contain all the information you need on laws, (European) codes and our own
Transmission
Services Conditions (TSC). Please read these rules and regulations, as they may be important for concluding transport contracts; maybe not now but in the future.Further to this we also explain how our invoicing
system
works.
The purpose of  the TSC is to complement the
Dutch Network Code
Gas
(in Dutch: ´Gasvoorwaarden´), to be established by the Dutch regulator ACM. As a consequence of new legislation the Network Code and the TSC have to be read in conjunction with one another to obtain a complete view of the relevant rules.
The ACM has established all parts of the ‘
Dutch Network Code
’. The established version of the
Network Code
can be found on
wetten.overheid.nl
