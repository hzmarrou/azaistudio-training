The Allocation Code
Gas
, laid down by the Dutch Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM), states that shippers in possession of a B license are subject to reconciliation service rules.
Reconciliation is the process of settling differences between consumption attributed to shippers based on profiles and actual confirmed consumption over a certain period, after the final allocations (version 4) have been determined. The settlement itself is done by the Local
Distribution
Companies (LDC’s).
Every month, LDC’s send reconciliation messages to the abovementioned shippers and to
GTS
, using the so-called RN_INFO messages.
GTS
checks the received information, aggregates the information per
shipper
and sends this aggregated information to the shippers using the so-called RS_INFO messages. Based on both messages, shippers are offered the opportunity to compare their recently received data on a monthly basis.
In the first half of April, debit invoices are sent to related shippers covering the first 6 months of the previous calendar year.
In the first half of October, debit invoices are sent to related shippers covering the last 6 months of the previous calendar year.
After the debit invoices have been settled, credit invoices covering the same period are sent to the other related shippers.
GTS
fulfills a facilitating role in this process.
Invoices are drawn up in Mega Joules (MJ) and settled against an average neutral
gas
price per calendar month. The average neutral
gas
price per month is stated on the invoice specification. The average neutral
gas
price per month can also be found in the document on this page. The
gas
prices are updated monthly.
