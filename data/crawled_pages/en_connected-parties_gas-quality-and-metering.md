Gas quality
Through its national
gas
transmission
system
GTS
is transporting, in separate
transmission
networks, two different qualities of
gas
: high-calorific
gas
(H-
gas
) and low-calorific
gas
(L-
gas
). A
connected party
(a
final customer
directly connected to the
transmission
network of
GTS
) receives
gas
of one of these two
gas
qualities. The specifications of these gases are laid down in annex 3 resp. 4 of the
Regeling gaskwaliteit
.
As a
connected party
, your equipment must be suited for natural
gas
with these specifications. In the annex 1B (exits) of the TSC (
Transmission Service Condition
), is noted to which ‘Gassysteem’ of the Regeling gaskwaliteit, your
connection
is attached. In this way, you can see which quality of
gas
is delivered to your
connection
.
Volume measurement
The amount of energy that a
connected party
is withdrawing from the national
gas
transmission
system
is determined. At the
gas
delivery station, the
connection
between the
transmission
system
and the installation of the
connected party
, the volume of
gas
withdrawn is measured. The
gas
composition is measured further upstream of the
gas
delivery station. From the volume withdrawn and the
gas
composition (more specific, the calorific value of the
gas
) the amount of energy is calculated.
The program responsible party or parties (the
shipper
) and the
supplier
(s) that are registered for an
exit point
to a
final customer
, are informed about the
gas
flows over that
exit point
. These parties as well as
GTS
will use this data for their invoicing. The amount of energy needs to be determined correctly and accurately. The process to measure
gas
flows and
gas quality
, including the accuracy of the measurements, is described in the
Meetcode Gas LNB
. Every year
GTS
publishes an
evaluation
of the performance of its
gas quality
and volume determination process. The fiscal metering process applied by
GTS
is ISO-9001 certified.
Metering data at exitpoints is also made available to the connected
final customer
. More information on this can be found on the webpage
shippers/balancing-regime/documents/connected-party
or on the webpage
Gasport and B2B
.
Gas quality
Two qualities of
gas
are transported in
GTS
’s
transmission
grid, i.e. H-
gas
(high-calorific
gas
) and G-
gas
(low-calorific or Groningen
gas
). An important measure for
gas quality
is the
Wobbe index
. The
"Regeling gaskwaliteit"
contains the Wobbe ranges.
You can indicate a preference for H-
gas
or G-
gas
on the "
Application form new connection
". Whether the preference indicated by a
connected party
can be honoured depends on the proximity of an H-
gas
or G-
gas
pipeline and the
available capacity
in the H- or G-
gas
system
.
Pressure
The
connected party
can state the desired pressure or pre-pressure at the
connection point
in bar (o). The
gas
transmission
grid has two networks, the RTL (regional
transmission
line) and the HTL (high-pressure
transmission
line). The RTL has a maximum pressure of 40 bar(o) and the HTL a maximum pressure of 67 or 80 bar(o). The effective pressure at the
connection point
is dependent on the distance from a compressor station or a metering and pressure-regulating station. The RTL network has a minimum pressure of ca. 8 bar(o) and the HTL network a minimum pressure of ca. 40 bar(o). If possible, we will take account of the desired pressure put forward by a
connected party
.
Odorisation
Gas
, which is odourless in its original state, has an odorant (THT) added to it at metering and pressure-regulating stations within the
gas
transmission
grid. You can indicate a preference regarding whether it wants to receive odorised
gas
or not. In some cases, pipelines with non-odorised and odorised
gas
lie alongside each other and sometimes a choice has to be made. Ultimately we decide the network to which a
connected party
will be connected. In the event that we offer a
connection point
to the non-odorised
gas
network, you must take your own safety precautions in the form of
gas
detection or by fitting an odorant production unit in its
gas
receiving station.
What sort of gas have I received?
In Gasport, under “Historical/Offline Metering /Quality per run”, connected parties can see which calorific value in a specified
hour
has been used for the energy determination for their
exit point
(s). The
density
, Wobbe, CO2 and N2 percentages are also shown here.
Please note; the energy determination requirements as set out in the Metering Conditions for
Gas
–
NNO
do not require the hourly calorific values determined by
GTS
at a delivery point to correspond exactly to the calorific value of the
gas
made available at that moment.
What sort of gas is available at my exit point at this moment?
In Gasport, under “Dispatching/Near real-time metering/Quality per run” details of
gas
composition are shown for every fifteen minutes. The calculated parameters such as Wobbe,
density
and calorific value are also shown here.
These values are determined by
GTS
on the basis of the
gas quality
system
as set out in the Metering Conditions for
Gas
-
NNO
. A description of the current
gas quality
system
can be found on this website. The consequence is that the value shown does not need to correspond every
hour
with the value of the
gas
made available at that moment. And so, for those reasons, the measurements reported are not suitable to be used for, for example, process control. These data are suitable for invoice control, however, provided they are not shown as being ‘unreliable’.
What sort of gas can I expect in the short term at my exit point?
This cannot be predicted exactly. Having said that, we have made a number of information services available for H-
gas
customers. These information services
supply
information about
gas
composition and/or flow duration in the network. Some services
supply
customer
-specific information (for a specific
connection point
) and consequently require the
connection
points to be configured in a specific manner. After configuration, the information services can, in many situations, make valuable  – near real time – predictions about
gas
compositions to be expected over the short term. More information can be obtained from the document “
Gas
Composition tracking for connected parties”.
What is the global flow situation in GTS’s H-gas transmission network?
We present a global view of the following on our website under ‘
Transport information
’:
what the current flow situation is in the H-
gas
transmission
network for the
Wobbe index
, the Propane Equivalent (PE number) and the Methane number.
and what the forecast is for the expected H-
gas
composition of the Maasmond LNG influx into our
transmission
network.
What sort of gas can I expect in the future?
The composition of the natural
gas
being offered to the market in the Netherlands is gradually changing. The Dutch
gas
supply
is declining and, as a result of this, producers and
gas
suppliers will be using more and more
gas
from other countries in Dutch networks.
Gas
is also becoming increasingly sustainable: consider developments in green
gas
. These developments have been launched by the government and will rapidly pick up pace over the coming years.
However, the
gas quality
at your
connection
must now and in the future meet a number of conditions that are laid down in the
gas quality
regulations (
Regeling gaskwaliteit
).
How can I see the relevant calibration certificates and the control results from the metering equipment installed at my exit point?
Gasport contains a “Historical/Offline metering/Request run information” page. Clicking on the “Send Information” button for each metering run causes an automatic request to be generated to send the relevant calibration certificates and control results to you, digitally, by email. This information will be in your possession by the following (working) day.
