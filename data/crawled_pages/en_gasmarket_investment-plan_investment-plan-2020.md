Until now,
GTS
complied with this legal provision through the Quality and
Capacity
Document (KCD / NOP). However, national legislation (Decisions 375 and MR WJZ / 18038636) was adopted in 2018, laying down further rules for the investment plan. The most important change is the status of the document: previously the NOP / KCD was offered to EZK and ACM for information, but the IP will be offered for approval. Approval of the IP therefore means approval of the described investments in the interior.
GTS
submitted the first IP to ACM and the Minister on 1 July 2020. They assessed the IP against Article 7a 2b of the
Gas
Act. ACM assessed whether
GTS
could reasonably have come to the draft investment plan and whether the investments described are necessary. EZK assessed whether
GTS
has taken sufficient account of developments in the energy market.
This investment plan applies for a period of eighteen months.
GTS
must then submit an IP to ACM and the Minister on 1 January of every even calendar year. In the event of significant changes, the IP can be revised in the interim by means of an addendum.
National legislation provides for a consultation. The consultation of the draft investment plan ran from 1 to 28 May 2020. In the run-up to the consultation,
GTS
organized two information sessions in November 2019 and March 2020, explaining the scenarios, the
capacity
and quality bottleneck identification methodologies and the necessary investments.
