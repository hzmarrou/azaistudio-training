What does it cost to terminate the connection?
There is no charge for terminating the
connection
but you do have to bear in mind the 3-month notice period. Your contractual obligations remain in force until the actual termination date.
Any
contracted capacity
cannot unfortunately be cancelled, except in the case of bankruptcy or business cessation, when contractual obligations arising from booked
capacity
are also terminated. 50% of the tariff of the remaining booking will be charged to the holder of the
capacity
for that.
Which articles apply to the termination of a connection?
Article 16 of the General Conditions for
Connection
Agreements, version 3.1 accompanying the
connection agreement
describe the conditions under which termination is possible.
In addition, article 6.A.11 of the TSC deals with the
supply
of
transmission capacity
in the event of bankruptcy or business cessation.
When will the connection be dismantled?
We will consult you when we start to dismantle the
connection
or part of it.
GTS
is responsible for removing the
connection
, including the connecting pipeline on your site. We will start to dismantle the
connection
within 2 years of the termination of the
connection agreement
.
The
supply
pipeline must always be depressurised before work can be done in the immediate vicinity of the
connection
or the
supply
pipeline.
How can I terminate the connection?

connection
or a part of the
