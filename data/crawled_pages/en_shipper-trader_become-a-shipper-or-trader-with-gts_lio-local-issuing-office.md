LIO stands for Local Issuing Office; this is the office responsible for the registration, issue and publication of EIC codes within the energy market (like the Central Issuing Office, CIO).
The acronym EIC stands for Energy Identification Code. It is an identification code used in Europe to uniquely identify entities and objects related to the electricity and
gas
sector. The coding scheme was developed by the Electronic Data Interchange Working Group and approved by ENTSO-E for the purpose of harmonising and implementing standardised electronic data interchange. The ultimate goal of this standard is to simplify cross-border trade and allow electronic data interchange to run efficiently and reliably.
