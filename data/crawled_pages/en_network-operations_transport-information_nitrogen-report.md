If the need for
QC
(see the FAQ) is high, surplus H-
gas
will be converted into G-
gas
by means of nitrogen. The ‘Nitrogen meter’ and related graphical or numerical retrievals provide information about amounts of nitrogen that are available for and have been used in
QC
.

Some remarks:
An overview      of
QC
and
RQC
can be found on the
QC/RQC      dashboard
.
Nitrogen is also used in the      H-
gas
transport
system
(including WQA). This use is      not part of the Nitrogen meter.
There are some small G-
gas
entries that are made suitable for the G-
gas
system
by means of nitrogen.      This will almost always involve using a small amount of nitrogen, even      though the total
gas
transport
system
is already in
RQC
mode.
There are no historical      measurements available about amounts of nitrogen available before      26-12-2015. Historical information about the “red and orange sections” are      not available before 07-04-2016.
Subdivision of nitrogen
capacity
The total quantity of nitrogen is subdivided into three categories:
Firm baseload nitrogen. All      available nitrogen in this category can be used without restriction.
Non-firm baseload nitrogen. For      this category nitrogen it is not possible to predict whether it can be      used at any desired time. This depends on various
gas
transport      technical factors. Once it is certain that the nitrogen in this
capacity
cannot      be used, it is reported as unavailable via
REMIT notifications
. When it is available is can      be used without restriction.
Firm nitrogen (Volume      Restricted). The nitrogen in this category comes from a nitrogen storage.      So long as there is enough disposable volume in the storage, the available      nitrogen in this category can be used without restriction. As soon as the      storage is empty, this category is reported as not available via a REMIT      report. Detailed information about the nitrogen storage can be found on      the
Nitrogen storage report
.
Remarks:
Part of the total amount of      nitrogen available (887.000 m3(n)/h) is regarded as reserve
capacity
to      cope with minor failures/faults in conversion resources.
The actual use of nitrogen does      not have to take place in the order indicated above. Which nitrogen is      used at which installation depends on various
gas
transport factors and      optimisations in the
gas
transport
system
.
Subdivision of nitrogen
capacity
Maintenance and long-term faults in
GTS
conversion installations and nitrogen production often mean that less nitrogen is available for conversion (see
maintenance calendar
). Acute and short-term faults also lead to a decrease in the availability of nitrogen.
REMIT reports
will be submitted to indicate a change in the availability of nitrogen as soon as this change occurs.
Planned nitrogen volume and utilisation rate
In the past the “Planned nitrogen volume” and “utilisation rate” was showed. This was the amount of nitrogen which was used in different studies and which amount always had to be available. This methodology is no longer used. The current values are no longer visible in the nitrogen meter. Also the (historical) data can no longer be retrieved in the nitrogen report. If desired, historical information can be requested from
GTS
.
Nitrogen meter
The Nitrogen meter shows the status of the available amount of nitrogen and the nitrogen use of the last available
hour
(in m3(n)/h). The Nitrogen meter scale runs from zero (bottom left) to the maximum amount of nitrogen available (887.000 m3(n)/h, bottom right).  This scale contains four colours. A green section on the left, if nitrogen use is in this section normal nitrogen is being used. There may be a black section on the right, this is the total amount of unavailable nitrogen. There is an orange section and a red section in the middle. The orange section indicates when a REMIT warning is sent, see below. The red section shows the reserve nitrogen
capacity
(also a REMIT is sent, see below) .  A black pointer on this scale shows the actual use. Underneath the meter the amount of used nitrogen is shown.
​ Nitrogen graph
The Nitrogen graph shows the amount of nitrogen available and nitrogen use per
hour
in the past 14 days (in m3(n)/h). The maximum amount of nitrogen that can be used is shown per category in three shades of grey. The yellow line shows the actual amount of nitrogen used. The orange and red dotted lines have the same meaning as the orange and red section described above at the Nitrogen meter.
Nitrogen report
The Nitrogen report gives the maximum volumes of nitrogen available and the volumes of actual nitrogen use (in m3(n)). Users can choose among various aggregations (
hour
, day, month, calendar year and
gas
year) and various periods.

Nitrogen used and REMIT reports
As soon as the
QC
approaches its boundary (the amount of available nitrogen is almost used up),
REMIT reports
will be issued to announce the fact.
Nitrogen use in orange section      (see Nitrogen meter). An advance notification / warning is issued to      indicate that the
QC
boundary is approaching.
GTS
asks market      participants to adjust their H-
gas
/G-
gas
balance to reduce nitrogen use. It      is needed to keep your POS in balance.
Nitrogen use in red section      (see Nitrogen meter). Nitrogen from the reserve
capacity
is      being used. A REMIT report is issued to indicate that the
QC
boundary has      been reached.
GTS
can instruct market participants to adjust their      H-
gas
/G-
gas
balance to reduce nitrogen use. It is needed to keep your POS      in balance. It is possible that market participants will be instructed to      bring all exit nominations for injection of G-
gas
storages to zero.
