Can I get my financial security back?
Yes, you can ask us to return all or part of your additional securities if you expect that you will no longer need the additional credit. The financial securities must be valid for at least 4 months after the
end date
of the longest
transmission
booking contract. If, for example, a
transmission
contract has expired, surplus unused credit becomes available. Your credit limit must at least cover your exposure but we advise you to keep a minimum of 15% of your credit limit as surplus unused credit.
My organization features a “warehouse arrangement” (in Dutch: entrepot-regeling). Do I have to take VAT into account when determining my exposure and credit limit?
No, in case your organization features a valid “warehouse arrangement”, VAT can be excluded when calculating your exposure and related credit limit.
During the gas day my organization is below 100% spent. Why can’t I contract any capacity.
Once a day at 06.00
hour
the available credit space per
customer
is interfaced to PRISMA . During the period that your spent percentage of 100% is exceeded, no
capacity
can be contracted.
