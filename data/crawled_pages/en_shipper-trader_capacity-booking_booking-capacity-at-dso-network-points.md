GTS
makes (planned)
capacity
available for exit points connected to
Distribution
System
Operators (DSO). At these points
gas
flows from the
national grid
into the regional (
distribution
) network.
Which shippers can use DSO
exit capacity
?
Shippers wishing to transport
gas
to the regional (
distribution
) network must have a B Licence (LB). You can find out more about this on our website under
Process steps for licence application
.
Do shippers have to book DSO
exit capacity
themselves?
No.
Exit capacity
at these points does not need to be booked in advance by shippers.
GTS
charges shippers for
capacity
monthly in arrears based on the OV-exit (M1) data received. If necessary, bookings can be adjusted four months later based on the OV-exit (M4) data.
What is the booking based on?
Bookings are based on OV-exit data from the Central
Connection Register
(C-AR). The C-AR is managed by Energie Data Services Nederland (EDSN). The C-AR records standard yearly usage per
connection
for profile customers and maximum usage for telemetry large-scale users. Every month, DSOs collect the OV-exit data from the C-AR and send this data to
GTS
and the shippers.
Contracting
capacity
at the virtual point for
distribution
companies (VPC) NWP 301549
The OV-exit data that
GTS
receives from the DSOs is aggregated per
shipper
for
capacity
contracting purposes and booked at a (virtual) DSO point: the virtual point for
distribution
companies (VPC).
Detailed information, such as standard yearly usage and maximum usage per individual network point, is available via the M1 and M4 OV-exit messages that shippers receive from the DSOs.
How does
GTS
calculate the
capacity
booked and amount payable on the invoice?
The calculation method is explained in the Excel file at the bottom of this page entitled ‘Factors and fractions DSO exit 202X calculation tool’. This document also contains a ‘Quick cost calculator’, which you can use to check the invoice amount.
How often does
GTS
revise the factors and fractions?
GTS
last revised the telemetry profile factors on 1 January 2023.We determine the hourly fractions for profile customers and the booking and split factors once a year (Q4).We determine fit factors for both M1 and M4 (adjustment) data every month.
