Through the
Capacity
Conversion service, previously contracted unbundled
capacity
at a virtual
interconnection point
(VIP) or an (underlying)
interconnection point
(IP) can be converted into bundled
capacity
at the IP or the (upper) VIP.
This service is based on the
ENTSOG capacity conversion model
according to article 21 (3) NC CAM.
CAPACITY
: The
capacity
(kWh) on      the existing unbundled booking must be at least as large as the bundled
capacity
to be purchased in the auction.
RUNTIME: The
end date
of      the existing unbundled contract must not be before the
end date
of the      bundled
capacity
offered in the auction.
If your situation does not meet these criteria, please contact our
Customer Desk
at least 10 working days before the start of the relevant auction to discuss the possibilities of a manual
capacity
conversion.
If your situation does meet the above conditions, the following applies:
During an auction for bundled
capacity
on the PRISMA platform you can indicate that you want to convert unbundled
capacity
to bundled
capacity
. An instruction ('Convert
capacity
at PRISMA auctions') can be found at the bottom of this webpage.
The unbundled and bundled
capacity
should of course be on the same (V)IP and in the same flow direction. The product type of the converted unbundled
capacity
remains applicable to the new bundled
capacity
. If on PRISMA an auction premium ('surcharge') has been paid for the new bundled
capacity
, this premium remains applicable on the total bundled
capacity
.
Capacity
conversion through PRISMA is possible during auctions of annual, quarterly, monthly and DA capacities. If manual actions are required,
capacity
conversion is not possible in DA auctions.
Capacity
conversion is not possible at all during auctions of within-day
capacity
.
After the end of a PRISMA auction, your existing unbundled contract will be reduced by the amount of the bundled
capacity
purchased at the auction. The
capacity
that becomes available again as a result of the conversion will be offered in the next auction of
capacity
for the same period. For example,
capacity
converted during the monthly auction will be offered again in the DA auction in the same month.
After the conversion has been successfully processed by
GTS
, you will receive a
confirmation
by email. If you converted
capacity
during the DA auction, this email will be sent around 17:45 LET.  If the conversion could not be performed, you will receive an email about this within a few minutes after the auction closes.
FAQ
Can I convert unbundled capacity contracted at an interconnection point (other than a VIP) directly to bundled capacity at the parent VIP?
Yes, this is possible. It is not necessary to first transfer the unbundled
capacity
(through the VIP transfer service) to the VIP. You can indicate during your auction bid on PRISMA the amount of unbundled
capacity
you wish to convert and the contract number (“BookingID”)that can be reduced by the same amount.
