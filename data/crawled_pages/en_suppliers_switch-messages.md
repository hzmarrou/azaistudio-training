Company EAN-code of the Program      Responsible Party/parties;
Name of the Programme      Responsible Party/parties;
Company EAN-code of      the

Supplier

Startdate/Enddate of the      relation between

When is a switchmessage needed?
When a
Connected party
changes his
Supplier
and/or
Programme Responsible Party
, the new
Supplier
sends the switchmessage to
GTS
.
The
switch
mutation form can be used for this purpose.
The new
Supplier
sends the switchmessage preferably one month but ultimately five working days before the switchdate to
GTS
, unless otherwise arranged with
GTS
.
The switchmessage is checked on several points:
Is the switchmessage complete      and syntactically correct;
Does the EAN-code belong to the      networkpoint of the
Connected party
;
Is the switchdate at least five      working days in the future (after receipt of the switchmessage);
Is the new
Supplier
registered      with
GTS
;
Has the Programme Responsible      Party (
Shipper
), registered in the
switch
message, booked      transport
capacity
on the networkpoint of the Connected partyh      from the start date onwards.
If the switchmessage is incomplete or not correct, the
Supplier
will be informed and has the possibility to deliver a correct switchmessage within 5 working days.
GTS
processed the changes as given in the switchmessage in the
switch
register and informs the
Supplier
and
Programme Responsible Party
after the change has become effective.
End of delivery to the
Connected Party
When the
supply
ends, the
Supplier
whose
supply
ends, sends the
switch
mutation form to
GTS
with an
end date
ultimately one month before the
end date
, unless otherwise arranged with
GTS
.
The following is checked:
Is the EAN-code of      the
Connection
registered in the
switch
register;
Is the enddate at least one      month in the future;
Does another
switch
for the      same
Connection
exist;
Is the
switch
send in by the
Supplier
registered in the
switch
register on the Connected networkpoint.
If the
switch
message is not correct or incomplete it will not be processed. The
Supplier
is informed and has the possibility to deliver a correct
switch
message within five working days.
GTS
processes the end delivery in the
switch
register and informs the
Supplier
and
Programme Responsible Party
(
Shipper
) after the change has become effective.
Retaining
capacity
and yearly update
On a yearly basis
GTS
informs, through a news message on the website, stakeholders about the retaining of
exit capacity
for Connected parties, as described in article 2.1.2.a of the Networkcode
Gas
– LNB.
Because many Connected parties usually plan to choose a new
Supplier
at the end of a year, it is of importance that the
switch
messages for these changes are send to
GTS
on time, considering the checks and processing.
For this purpose
GTS
sends an overview with the applicable registrations of
Connected party
-NWP and
Supplier
-
Shipper
combination to the registered Suppliers, with the request to send in changes by using the
switch
mutation form.
The
Connected party
also receives the message about the retaining of
capacity
by mail.
