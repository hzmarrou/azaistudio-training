The
transmission
networks operated by
GTS
consist of pipelines and facilities. These networks are divided into a main
transmission
network (HTL) and a regional
transmission
network (RTL), based on pressure class. The HTL (high pressure, big pipelines) transports
gas
at national level; the RTL is the intricate
distribution network
(medium pressure, smaller pipelines) to which local
gas
distribution
companies are connected. The HTL is divided into a high-calorific network (H-
gas
) and a low-calorific network (G-
gas
) based on
gas
type.
The RTL starts at a metering and pressure control station which is supplied with
gas
from the HTL. The RTL is used almost exclusively for transporting G-
gas
.
The figure below shows the HTL in the form of a diagram
The HTL networks are interconnected via blending stations, where different combinations of H-
gas
and nitrogen are fed into the G-
gas
network. As well as pipelines, the HTL networks also contain many compressor stations. These stations can increase the pressure of the
gas
to facilitate further transport.
Gas
enters
GTS
’s HTL network at entry points. Incoming
gas
is sourced from domestic production (green and grey), border points, LNG terminals and
gas
storage facilities.
Gas
leaves
GTS
’s network at exit points. These include not only domestic exits, where
gas
is supplied to local
distribution
companies, directly connected industries or
gas
storage facilities, but also border points, where
gas
is supplied to neighbouring foreign networks.
