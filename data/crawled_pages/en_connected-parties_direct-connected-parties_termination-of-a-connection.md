Complete or partial termination of the
connection
It is possible to terminate all or part of the
connection
to our grid. A written request is required for a complete termination in order that the
Connection Agreement
associated with the
connection
is also terminated. The notice period required for terminating the
connection
is three months, as stated in the General Conditions which are applicable to the
Connection Agreement
or
system
connection agreement
.
Dismantling the
connection
A
connection
can be completely dismantled or partially dismantled, if, for instance only part of the
gas
delivery station needs to be dismantled. In that case
GTS
will ask you, as the
connected party
, to state on the form below that there are one or more runs to be dismantled.
We will consult you when we start to dismantle the
connection
or part of it.
GTS
is responsible for removing the
connection
. We will start to dismantle the
connection
or part of the
connection
within two years of termination of the
connection agreement
.
The
supply
pipeline must always be depressurised before work can be done in the immediate vicinity of the
connection
or the
supply
pipeline.
Below you will find the application form for termination of a
connection
