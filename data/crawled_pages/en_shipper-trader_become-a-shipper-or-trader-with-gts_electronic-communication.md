To meet the conditions for obtaining a licence you must be able to use electronic communication for nominations, transport programmes and balancing actions. On this page we explain what is necessary for that.
Message exchange communication test
We think it is important for all systems to be working properly so that you can use your contracted services 24/7. With a communication test, we test connectivity via a technical AS4
connection
and whether we can exchange specific Edig@s XML messages with you. The step-by-step plan for this test is set out below. There is information on technical and operational requirements at the bottom of this page.
Step 1 Start of communication test
Once your application for a licence is being processed, you will receive a communication test form from our
Customer
Licensing team, in which you can provide contact details for the communication test. This can be your own IT department or a service provider (see also below ‘Use my own
connection
or opt for a service provider?’). This information is then passed on to the
Nomination
Support team.
Step 2 Information for carrying out the communication test
You will receive an email from the
Nomination
Support team, in which we will indicate what IT information is required to perform the communication test and the steps that will be followed.
Step 3 Set up test
connection
in acceptance environment
Following receipt of the IT information, we will liaise with the contact person (or service provider) specified by you and set up an AS4
connection
in the acceptance environment.
Step 4 Technical
connection
test
Technical testing of the AS4
connection
in the acceptance environment is carried out by exchanging test files with you.
Step 5 Exchanging Edig@s messages
Depending on the licence type, we will test with you whether the required Edig@s messages are created and routed correctly.
Step 6 Set up
connection
in production environment
Following receipt of the IT information, we will liaise with the contact person (or service provider) specified by you and set up an AS4
connection
in the production environment.
Step 7 Technical
connection
test
Technical testing of the AS4
connection
in the production environment is carried out by exchanging test files with you.
Step 8 Exchanging an Edig@s message
Finally, we will test with you whether an Edig@s message is routed correctly.
Step 9 Completion of communication test
After the successful completion of steps 1 to 8, the communication test is finished and the
Nomination
Support team passes this on to the
Customer
Licensing team. The
Customer
Licensing team then informs your contact person for the licensing process.
Technical requirements for electronic communication
All electronic messaging is based on the Edig@s protocol. This is a European standard for preparing  XML messages relating to
gas
transport. For information about Edig@s, please refer to the
Edig@s group
website. We always support the two most recent versions of Edig@s. Please go to the bottom of this page for documents and examples.
The above-mentioned Edig@s messages can only be exchanged with us using a technical AS4
connection
. Setting up such a
connection
can be simplified by using the
EASEE-connect
platform. We recommend using this platform but it is not obligatory.
Use my own
connection
or opt for a service provider?
If you wish to apply for a licence with
GTS
, we advise you to assess at an early stage the extent to which your IT systems are capable of generating and exchanging Edig@s messages via AS4. You can set up your own
connection
and messaging
system
or hire a service provider who specialises in such work, provided that your Dispatch department is available 24/7.
If you use a service provider, we will need a ‘mandate letter’ stating that the company concerned is allowed to take care of messaging on your behalf.
Operational procedures for nominating and balancing
For electronic communication it is important that you are familiar with the operational procedures for nominating, programmes, balancing,
system
balance and balancing actions. This is required to exchange Edig@s messages with the correct content. You can find the operational procedures for nominating in the latest version of the
Transmission
Service Conditions (
TSC
), Appendix 5. The
nomination
process is described on our website under ‘
Nomination
process and matching’. Processes relating to programmes, balancing, imbalances and balancing actions is described on our website under ‘Balancing regime’.
Permitted Edig@s versions for electronic communication
With the introduction of Edig@s v6.1 in the autumn of 2024, both affiliated and new parties of
GTS
will gradually have the opportunity to test this new Edig@s version and transition. Given that
GTS
allows the last two Edig@s versions for messaging, the phase-out period for Edig@s v4.0 will also start in the autumn of 2024. Below an overview:
Edig@s v4.0, introduced in 2007 and will be permitted until the      beginning of Q4-2025 at the latest.
Edig@s v5.1, introduced in 2013.
Edig@s v6.1, introduced in Q3-2024 and is currently the recommended version.

FAQ
What is the lead time for a communication test?
The lead time depends on a number of factors. If your IT
system
is suitable for electronic messaging or if you use a service provider who is familiar with
GTS
, then it will usually be possible to complete the process within a few weeks. The time required will also depend on how quickly staff respond and their availability. You should allow for a lead time of at least four weeks.
