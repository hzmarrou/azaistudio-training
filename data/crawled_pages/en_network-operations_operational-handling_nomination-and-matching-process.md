Gas
is transported within the Netherlands and to our partner countries based on nominations sent by shippers to
Gasunie Transport Services
’ (
GTS
’s)
nomination
system
. As a
shipper
, you should submit a
nomination
indicating to us how much
gas
(in kWh/h) you wish to transport for each
hour
of the
gas day
at a network point.
Nomination
process for physical entry and exit points
Nominations are obligatory for any network point for which you have
contracted capacity
with us. Exemption from the
nomination
obligation is only possible on the basis of article 2.3 from Appendix 5 of our TSC.
Nominations will be validated against the
capacity
booked by you for the network point concerned when they are received. If the
nomination
is higher than this
capacity
, you will be notified. In that case, the
nomination
will be rejected and no longer included in the process. If you do not renominate (on time) within your
contracted capacity
, you will receive a zero
confirmation
; a zero
nomination
will then be assumed.
Initial nominations must be received by us before 14.00 hours on the
gas day
prior to the
gas day
on which transport is to take place. If required, and provided that the term of the contract allows for this, nominations can be made up to 179 days in advance.
You will receive your confirmations from us before 16.00 hours on the
gas day
prior to the
gas day
on which transport is to take place. If your
confirmation
deviates from the
nomination
, the
confirmation
will also contain the reason for this deviation; this may be a mismatch or an interruption, for example.
Nominations received by us between 14.00 and 16.00 hours will also be validated immediately for
capacity
. You will be informed about the result of this check straight away. Your
nomination
will only be considered for further processing during the
renomination
process (after 16.00 hours). Changes in nominations can be indicated by submitting a
renomination
, which must take into account the
lead time
at the network point concerned. We will process a
nomination
or
renomination
from the next full
hour
(clock
hour
) after receiving it.
The matching process takes place between
GTS
and the Neighbouring
Network Operator
(
NNO
) at almost all border points and offshore pipeline landfall points. This means that messages containing
nomination
information are exchanged between
GTS
and the
NNO
comparing the nominations received by
GTS
with the nominations received by the
NNO
. If there are any differences, the standard matching rule, the Lesser of Rule (LoR), is applied. Specifically, this means that whichever is the lowest
nomination
value, the one submitted by our
shipper
or the one submitted by its
NNO
countershipper, will be the value confirmed to both shippers. Both
GTS
and the
NNO
will send a message to confirm the matching result to their own shippers.
If it is necessary to interrupt nominations with respect to
interruptible booked
capacity
, this will take place prior to the matching process. Interruption is based on priority; where contracts have equal priority (the same timestamp), further allocation will take place on a pro rata basis. The interruption result will be included in the further process and is visible via the
confirmation
.
Nominations for TTF and TTFB
On the virtual network points TTF and TTFB entry paid
gas
can be transferred by nominating. If no transfer is to take place there is no need to nominate. This is different from physical network points, where nominating is required. Nominations submitted must contain
portfolio
codes admitted by and valid at
GTS
. If required, nominations can be made up to 400 days in advance at these virtual network points.
The matching process is based on initial nominations of shippers transferring
gas
to each other. All Future and Day Ahead nominations received before 04.00 hours will be included in the matching process in the next full clock
hour
. From 04.30 hours, the matching process takes place every 30 minutes to ensure that all nominations or renominations are confirmed on time before the start of the new, and during the current,
gas day
.
A lead time of 30 minutes applies on the TTF and TTFB.
A
confirmation
is given ‘No Counternomination’ (NC) status if either party has not yet submitted a
nomination
. Confirmations are given ‘Settled’ (S) status if both nominated values match. If this is not the case, then the
confirmation
is given ‘MisMatch’ (MM) status and the lowest value is confirmed to both parties in accordance with the ‘Lesser of Rule’ (LoR).
Confirmations on the TTF and TTFB are given ‘Unchanged Settled’ (US) status if either party sends in an amended
renomination
after a ‘Settled’ deal was previously confirmed. Specifically, this means that the previously confirmed value remains intact and that, after having concluded a ‘Settled’ deal, parties cannot unilaterally change their deal. Another
confirmation
will be sent out with a ‘Settled’ (S) status deal only when both parties renominate and the nominated values match.
It is not possible to submit renominations for TTFB for the current
gas day
; the message will therefore be rejected and not included in the further matching process.
Producer Prevail (PP) matching rule
The standard matching rule on border points with so called Neighbouring
Network Operator
(NNOs) is the Lesser of Rule (LoR). This means that when
nomination
values received are different, the lowest value prevails and is confirmed to both parties.
However, there is a deviation from this standard matching rule at some network border points and a different rule has been agreed with the Neighbouring
Network Operator
(
NNO
): the Producer Prevail (PP) rule. Here, this rule is the default matching rule at the network point concerned and is usually in place between
GTS
and NNOs with onshore or offshore pipelines to which several producers are connected. The Producer Prevail rule means that, if there is a difference in nominations received by
GTS
and received by a producer, the
nomination
submitted by the
NNO
shipper
(upstream) will prevail. In other words, this will be approved by
GTS
(without any reduction) and confirmed to its shippers (downstream).
When finalising the contract and before delivery starts, it is advisable to agree with both
GTS
and the
NNO
(producer) which matching rule will apply. It is assumed that, on the instructions of its
shipper
, the
NNO
(producer) will implement the same matching rule in its
nomination
system
and apply it in its matching process.
