Gasunie Transport Services
(
GTS
) and BBL Company (BBLC) have integrated their transport systems in one TTF Trading Zone as of 1 January 2018 by removing the
Interconnection Point
(IP) Julianadorp. As a result, the BBL
interconnector
has become part of the TTF market area.
GTS
and BBLC have a joint entry/exit
system
in which they can continue to operate as independent TSOs. This integration creates a direct
connection
between Europe’s two largest
gas
trading platforms: the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) and the British National Balancing Point (NBP).
With a direct
connection
between these market areas shippers can transport
gas
between TTF and NBP more easily and efficiently. Shippers are therefore able to anticipate on tariff differences between TTF and NBP. The improved arbitrage opportunities lead to lower price differences and price fluctuations between the two trading places.
Operational communication document
The key points for the integration of the BBL pipeline into the TTF market area, such as the detailed operational processes and the go-live, are addressed via this operational communication document.
