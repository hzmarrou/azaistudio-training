Certificates not only provide certainty about the identity of the owner, but also give the potential for encryption. For us, encryption and integrity are key prerequisites for secure Internet communication.
There are many ways to encrypt and secure files. However, in practice, the public and private key method has proven to be the most reliable. This method uses two keys, a public and a private key. The sender encrypts the messages using the recipient’s public key. To render it legible again, the recipient decrypts the message using his private key. For communication with
GTS
, this happens automatically.
In simple terms, a certificate ensures that through a combination of a
user
name and a password, you can log in to secure parts of our website.
