If you are a
shipper
or a direct
connected party
wishing to start up a new industrial
connection
or expand an existing one, you can contract the commissioning service for industry.
This service allows you to give an estimate of how much
capacity
a new or modified industrial plant will need during the commissioning phase. The maximum period for which the commissioning phase can be contracted for is four months.
We will consider this estimate to be a provisional
capacity
booking and surcharges for exceeding provisional
capacity
will not apply. During this period the
shipper
or
directly connected party
can determine the amount of
capacity
actually required in future. The final booking of the
capacity
used during the agreed commissioning period is determined retrospectively based on actual use, so the fiscal metering data. In practice this means that the highest measured hourly flow for each of these contracted months in service is used as final
capacity
. So this highest hourly measured flow per month will be added as used
capacity
to the contract for the period in this service.
