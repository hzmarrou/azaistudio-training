We use the entry-exit
system
for selling
gas
transmission
services. This means that the pipeline network has entry points (about 50) and exit points (about 1,100).
An
entry point
is a place in the pipeline network where the
gas
can be physically injected into the
system
, an
exit point
is a place where the
gas
can be physically removed from the
system
(for example, a
gas
delivery station or an export station).
Our customers buy
capacity
in advance at these entry and  exit points so that they can inject
gas
into the
system
at a specific point and take it off again at a different location (= transport). The
customer
is free to choose the combinations of entry and exit points but must ensure that a certain balance is maintained between the volume of
gas
injected into the
system
and the volume taken off. That is why we have set up a balancing regime.
We provide both firm (assured) and
interruptible
entry and
exit capacity
.
Firm capacity
means that the
customer
is sure that he can use the
capacity
he has purchased. That is not the case with
interruptible capacity
, where there is a certain chance of interruption.
Interruptible capacity
will only be sold when all
firm capacity
is sold out.
Capacity
with a higher probability of being interrupted will only be sold when all
capacity
with a lower probability of being interrupted is sold out.
The
gas
present in our
system
can change ownership easily before it leaves the
system
at an
exit point
. This makes
gas
trading possible (see also the
gas
trading exchange, the TTF).
