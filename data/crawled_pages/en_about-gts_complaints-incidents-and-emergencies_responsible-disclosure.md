Responsible Disclosure
The form couldn't be processed, please try again.
We pay a lot of attention to      the safety and security of our information systems. However, if you find a      weakness or something that could be improved, we would like you to inform      us as soon as possible.
The National Cyber Security      Center (NCSC) of the Dutch ministry of Security and Justice has issued      recommendations on how to deal with the reporting and handling of security      weaknesses in a responsible manner. We have adopted these recommendations,      and in addition have implemented the following Responsible Disclosure      guidelines:
Report your findings by       filling out the applicable form.
Do not abuse the weakness (by       copying, change or delete data) and do not share the information with       others until the weakness is fixed.
All communication shall take       place via Gasunie.
If you do find a weakness in      our system or see things that could be improved, we will:
Respond to your report within       5 working days with our assessment and an estimated date of a solution;
Treat your report       confidentially and not share your information with others unless we are       legally obligated to do so;
Not take any legal action       regarding the reporting person if he/she has acted in accordance with the       security policy and in a proportionate manner, as specified by the NCSC,       unless there has been a breach of or damage to third-party systems, other       persons or personal information.
We may also decide to express our appreciation and / or offer public credit to the discloser. This will be decided on a case-by-case basis.
