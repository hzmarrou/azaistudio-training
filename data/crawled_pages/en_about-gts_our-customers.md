When providing access to the national natural
gas
network, we aim for openness and transparency. Available capacities for each entry and
exit point
can be accessed publicly in digital form. Efficiency is also a top priority. It goes without saying that we always act in accordance with the physical capabilities of our transport network.
GTS
has two main
customer
groups: shippers and connected parties (end users).
Shippers
Shippers, approximately 200 in total, have a
transport contract
with
GTS
. In other words, they have
contracted capacity
at both an entry and an
exit point
(see entry and exit
system
). So a
shipper
brings a certain volume of natural
gas
into the ‘
GTS
system
’ at a contracted
entry point
and takes off the same volume of natural
gas
at a contracted
exit point
. A
shipper
can also book other services with us, such as our flexibility service.Shippers are companies approved by
GTS
that meet the criteria below:
They accept
GTS
’s standard terms and conditions for transport, together with the associated appendices. These terms and conditions are set out in the ´
Transmission
Service Conditions (TSC)´.
They are found to be creditworthy by
GTS
or are able to provide additional financial security.
Special rules also apply to communication between the
shipper
and
GTS
. The parties have to be able to use an electronic messaging
system
.
GTS
will have to test and approve the
shipper
’s operational use of the
system
.
Connected parties
Over 1,100 companies and organisations are directly connected to our
national grid
. We call these companies and organisations 'connected parties’ or ‘end users’. These include major industries, power plants, producers and network companies in the Netherlands and abroad. Most of these customers will buy the
gas
they need from a
supplier
. A
shipper
makes sure that this
gas
is delivered to the
connected party
via
GTS
’s network.
Connected parties may contract
exit capacity
without
entry capacity
. They transfer this
exit capacity
to the
shipper
who is going to deliver the
gas
to them. In such cases, a
connected party
is known as an '
end user with exit capacity
'. Connected parties can also opt to transport
gas
through
GTS
’s transport network themselves. Then they are not only
connected party
but also
shipper
and then they will need to contract both exit and
entry capacity
.
The illustration above shows which contracts are used for
gas
transport in the Netherlands.
Left:
GTS
concludes a
Connection Agreement
with connected parties. The connected parties in turn have a delivery contract with a
supplier
.
Centre:
The contract between the shippers and
GTS
is governed by the terms and conditions set out in the
Transmission
Service Conditions (TSC). A
shipper
has a delivery contract with a
supplier
(or is itself a natural
gas
supplier
).
Right:
Local
distribution
companies (LDCs) are also connected to
GTS
’s network and are therefore ‘connected parties’. The LDCs transport the
gas
through their own networks to end users such as households and office buildings. They conclude
connection
and transport contracts with these customers. The
end user
has also concluded a delivery contract with a
supplier
. Most households have a contract with a
supplier
that includes their
connection
and transport costs and so they will not have concluded separate
connection
and transport contracts.
