GTS
has set up an emergency procedure for shippers in order to be able to continue to book short-term
capacity
when unannounced disruptions on the PRISMA platform at (virtual) interconnection points occur. This service is provided on a best-effort basis.
The requested
capacity
can be booked by shippers using the form Request for entry and / or
exit capacity
. This form is available at the bottom of this page. After the form has been completed, it must be sent by email to both
[email protected]
and
[email protected]
.
Only
interruptible capacity
can be booked via the emergency procedure. This prevents (the same)
firm capacity
being sold twice. When the disruption is solved on PRISMA, all
firm capacity
available before the disruption will be (re)offered for the remainder of the day.
Procedure during disruption Day Ahead auction
PRISMA      informs the market through an Urgent Market Message (UMM) that a      disruption occurred at the time of the Day Ahead (DA) auction.
The      upcoming Within Day (WD) auction will act as fall back. This auction      starts at 19:00 LET.
If      this auction is also disrupted, PRISMA will try to start this auction      again until about 21:45 LET. If PRISMA’s actions do not succeed, the      market will be informed at approximately 22:00 LET.
If      both the DA and the subsequent WD auction that starts at 19:00 LET are      disrupted, shippers can book
capacity
for the      next
gas day
between 22:00 LET and 2:30 LET with the      aforementioned form at
GTS
.
Procedure during disruption Within Day auction
PRISMA      informs the market through an Urgent Market Message (UMM) that a      disruption has occurred at the WD auctions.
If      the disruption occurs for first WD auction of      the
gas day
(19:00 LET), than the procedure "Procedure      during disruption Day Ahead auction" applies.
If      the disruption occurs at an auction other than the first WD auction, 2      hours after the start time of the disturbed      auction,
capacity
can be booked through the form Request      for entry and/or
exit capacity
. The emergency procedure ends      when the problems on the PRISMA platform have been resolved.
GTS
will      try to maintain the same lead time / processing time during the manual      emergency procedure as under
normal conditions
during the      auctions on Prisma. For example: when the Within-Day auction at 14:00 LET      is disturbed and this is still the case at 16:00 LET, a
shipper
must have submitted      the form with requested
capacity
between 16:00 LET and before 16:30 LET      when the
shipper
wants to buy
capacity
from 20:00 LET until 6:00 LET.
When booking using the form,
shipper
must take into account the lead time for nominations and the processing time of the application by
GTS
.
