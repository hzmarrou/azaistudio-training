Can I convert unbundled capacity contracted at an interconnection point (other than a VIP) directly to bundled capacity at the parent VIP?
Yes, this is possible. It is not necessary to first transfer the unbundled
capacity
(through the VIP transfer service) to the VIP. You can indicate during your auction bid on PRISMA the amount of unbundled
capacity
you wish to convert and the contract number (“BookingID”)that can be reduced by the same amount.
