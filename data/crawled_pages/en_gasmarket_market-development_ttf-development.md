On this page the development of the Title Transfer Facility (the TTF) is shown. TTF is a virtual market place that offers market parties the possibility to transfer
gas
already in the
GTS
system
to another market player.
Both the development of the volume traded at TTF and the development of the net volumes are shown. The volume traded is based on information from LEBA, ICIS Heren and exchanges. The net volume corresponds to the sum of the net hourly positions per TTF
shipper
as registered by
GTS
. The net volume can be seen as the “physical
gas
flow” through TTF.
The figure hereunder shows the development of monthly volumes on TTF. The yellow line and the gray line represent the volume traded, the brown columns represent the net volume. The number of active parties at the end of a month is represented in the blue line.
