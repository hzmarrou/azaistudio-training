This page describes the general operation of our entry and exit
system
and how you, as a
customer
, can book transport with us on that
system
.
The entry-exit
system
GTS
operates an entry-exit
system
where
gas
flows into the network at entry points and leaves the network at exit points.
Entry capacity
gives shippers the right to inject a specific volume of
gas
per
hour
into the
national grid
at an
entry point
.
Exit capacity
gives them the right to withdraw a specific volume of
gas
per
hour
from the
national grid
at an
exit point
. You can book these capacities with
GTS
through the PRISMA platform.
How do I book?
On PRISMA there are two methods for booking
capacity
with
GTS
.
Auctions
are used for all connections to other entry and exit systems.
DSO contracting
is used for connections to
distribution
networks. If you are feeding in
gas
from a small field, this is governed by special contractual provisions, known as the
SFA
. At all other points, the FCFS principle,
First Come First Served
, is used.
Contracts with a standard term
Since 2020, it has been possible to book transport
capacity
by choosing one of five standard products, i.e.: Yearly, Quarterly, Monthly, Day and Within-Day products. Separate contracts must be concluded for each product and every booking will be given its own unique Booking ID.
GTS
performs an availability test and a technical transport test for the purpose of allocating transport
capacity
.
Tariffs
The Dutch Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) has set tariffs for each entry and
exit point
; these can be found in appendix 1 of the relevant
TSC
.

Shipper
and
connected party
Provided it has a special
licence
to do so, a party that is directly connected to the
GTS
network [
EWEX
], such as an industry, can book
exit capacity
itself at its
connection
that links up with
GTS
’s network. Because the
directly connected party
cannot ‘ship’
gas
itself, the booked
capacity
must always be
traded
to a
customer
with a
shipper licence
.
Portfolio
GTS
accepts
gas
offered at entry points, transports it and makes it available at exit points. You can freely combine entry and exit points. A
portfolio
brings together a collection of entry and exit contracts relating to the same
shipper
. You may have several portfolios but remember that all portfolios must be kept in balance separately by you.
Balancing
You do not need to book entry and
exit capacity
simultaneously. When using the
contracted capacity
, you should be aware that the transport network must be in balance so that
gas
can be transported safely and efficiently. You are yourself primarily responsible for the volume of
gas
you withdraw or feed in. If an imbalance does arise, we will establish, for each
portfolio
, whether the
portfolio
contributed towards causing the imbalance or whether it helped to reduce the imbalance, and this may involve costs. More information can be found under the subject
balancing regime
.
