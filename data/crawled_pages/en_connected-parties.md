“Connected parties” covers parties that are connected or directly connected to
GTS
’s
gas
transmission
grid such as industries, power plants and private network operators and also, for example, injectors such as green
gas
injectors. Usually, however, an exit is specified. You will find more information about network operators under
System operators
. As a
connected party
you can make agreements with
GTS
regarding the conditions under which
gas
will be made available to you. These conditions are laid down in a
Connection Agreement
(aansluitovereenkomst (AO)).  It has been determined by law under art. 1. 2. 1 of the
Connection
Code
Gas
TSO that
GTS
may only make
gas
available if
GTS
and the
connected party
have concluded a
Connection Agreement
.
Generally, connected parties can choose a
supplier
from which they will buy the
gas
. The
supplier
will then ensure that
capacity
is booked with
GTS
; this is done via a
shipper
. A
connected party
can also book transport
capacity
itself; in order to do so the
connected party
needs to become an
End User with Exit Capacity
(
EWEX
) by obtaining an
EWEX
licence. Previously it could be beneficial for connected parties to have an
EWEX
licence because this enabled them to book long-term
capacity
. This guaranteed security of
gas
transport for them. Now, however,
GTS
reserves the booked
capacity
at industrial exits for the coming year, and up to 1 December in the current year, see article 2. 1. 2. a of the
Transmission
Code
Gas
– TSO. As a
connected party
you are therefore assured that the booked
capacity
in the current year will also be available for you in the following year provided it has been booked before 1 December. Bookings after 1 December are dealt with on a first-come-first-served basis.
This website, will provide you with further information on
applying
for,
modifying
or
terminating
a
connection
.
You can also find information about our commissioning service. This service aims to facilitate new connections or expansions to existing industrial connections by applying a simpler
capacity
booking regime.
Finally: It is in both our interests for us to have access to your up-to-date contact details, so that we can, for example, reach you quickly if a disaster occurs or is likely to occur.
