An Operational Balancing Account (hereinafter: OBA) is a continuous balancing account between
GTS
and an adjacent
system
operator (such as operators of adjacent networks, storage facilities or production plants), to be used to manage steering differences at a network point in order to simplify allocations to network users involved at the network point (as defined in NC INT, article 2.g.).
An OBA can be set up both at border points (in accordance with NC INT) and at domestic network points.
The purpose of the OBA is twofold:
To provide shippers with certainty about their desired allocation: if an OBA is used, the allocation of transported quantities to shippers is equal to the
confirmation
(Allocation =
Confirmation
).
To accommodate steering differences allowing
system
operators to deviate from the sum of the confirmations to shippers, by mutual agreement, if so desired by either
system
operator for optimisation purposes or to facilitate operational activities.
An OBA has a limited scope and is, on balance, zero over time.
The OBA may be closed temporarily or permanently by either
GTS
or the
system
operator concerned. In that case energy quantities will be allocated according to the existing default rule for the
connection point
in question (usually proportional
distribution
).
OBAs are only used for operational, not commercial, purposes.
Characteristics of the OBA may depend on the specific features of the
gas
transport situation concerned and on those of the adjacent
system
operator’s
system
.
What are the conditions for setting up an OBA with
GTS
?
Eligibility for an OBA at a network point will be assessed, in each case, by
GTS
according to how well the
system
operator concerned can meet the requirements below, given the local transport situation:
The exact arrangements will be set out in an Interconnection Agreement (IA) or a Storage
Connection Agreement
(SCA).
Sufficient steering precision.
Potential for steering OBA positions back to 0.
Limited risks in the event of failure of
supply
or intake.
Which network points have an OBA?
OBAs are in place at a limited number of network points in
GTS
’s network. The summary below supplements the list of border points with an OBA, as published at
Operational Arrangements NC Interoperability
