The main steps in the incremental
capacity
process are:
Indicative demand assessment This is the non-binding demand assessment phase where market parties can      submit their
capacity
demand to the TSO’s by filling out a demand      indication form. In consultation with the neighboring TSO’s, it is decided      whether the non-binding demand indication(s) give rise to offering      incremental
capacity
. If so, the next phase of the process will start.
Design phase In this phase, technical studies are carried out and a financial      assessment is made of the measures to be taken. Together with other TSOs,      projects are defined for the realization of incremental
capacity
. After      consultation of the market parties the TSO’s will decide upon the final      project proposals.
Approval of the project      proposals The project proposals will be submitted to the national regulatory      authorities for approval.
Binding demand assessment The incremental
capacity
to be developed is offered at the auction. The      results of the auction are input for an economic test. The outcome of the      economic test determines the implementation of the proposed projects.
Realization of the proposed      projects that passed the economic test.
From 1 July 2019 to 25 August 2019, market parties were able to express their non-binding demand for incremental
capacity
for the 2019-2021 process. The market demand assessment reports are published below.

In accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2017/459 (NC CAM),
GTS
performed a market demand assessment in the period 1 July 2019 to 25 August 2019 with the aim of gaining insight into the need for additional
capacity
at interconnection points from market parties. The results of this demand assessment have been translated into concrete proposals for expanding
capacity
. The documents with these proposals are available for consultation on our website from today until October 1, 2020. The additional
capacity
that will eventually become available on the basis of the results of this consultation and approval from the regulators will be offered on PRISMA in the 2021 annual auction.

Based on the demand indication and the consultation,
GTS
, Gasunie Deutschland and GASCADE have drawn up a coordinated project proposal for the incremental
capacity
process 2019. This project proposal was submitted to BundesNetzAgentur and the Authority for Consumers & Markets for approval on 2 November.

Completion Incremental
Capacity
Process 2019-2021
Parallel to the Incremental
Capacity
Process 2019-2021, scenarios have been developed for the German Network Development Plan 2020 (hereinafter: NEP). These scenarios show a situation in which the transport capacities from Germany required for the security of
supply
in the Netherlands are at stake. Therefore, additional
capacity
of 12 GWh / h on the virtual
interconnection point
(VIP) THE-TTF-H has been added to the concept NEP. The draft NEP was consulted in the market by the BNetzA on 19 March 2021. The consultation did not lead to any changes to the NEP. The NEP was then finalized on April 21, 2021. This means there is an obligation for the German TSOs to invest to make this
capacity
available. The additional
capacity
of 12 GWh / h from Germany to the Netherlands exceeds the
capacity
of 10.7 GWh / h that was requested in the demand indication of the Incremental
Capacity
Process 2019-2021. Therefore, no additional measures are needed to make the requested
capacity
available.
GTS
, Gasunie Deutschland, OGE and GASCADE are therefore withdrawing the project proposal that they submitted to BNetzA and ACM on 1 November 2020 as part of the Incremental
Capacity
Process 2019-2021.
From the perspective of the TSOs involved, the Incremental
Capacity
Process 2019-2021 has thus been completed.
