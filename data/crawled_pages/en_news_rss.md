		<p>During the Shipper Meeting on 7 November 2024, GTS expressed its concerns about a number of issues observed with the Nexthour product (including limited liquidity and remarkable price setting). Market participants were then asked to make suggestions to improve these. We welcomed the large number of constructive feedback received in response.</p><p>On 12 December 2024, this was discussed with the representative organisations (RepOrgs) and here, too, the need to resolve the issues identified was recognised. GTS has started a study into the perceived issues and with which (set of) measures they could be mitigated. The results of this study are expected to be discussed with the aforementioned RepOrgs in April 2025.</p><p>Based on this, a preferred direction will be determined. GTS will translate this preferred direction into a formal proposal to be discussed in a GEN meeting with the RepOrgs.</p><p>If the final proposal has implications for current regulations, a code amendment proposal will then be submitted to regulator ACM via the procedures usual for this purpose at Netbeheer Nederland.</p><p>In the aforementioned meeting on 12 December 2024, the legally required evaluation of the functioning of the rules around preventing undesirable balancing behaviour (UBB), as laid down in Art. 4.1.4.7 and 4.1.4.8 of the Gas LNB Transport Code, was also carried out. The results have been shared with ACM. A copy of this letter can be found&#xA0;<u><a href="https://www.gasunietransportservices.nl/uploads/fckconnector/1d9ea8f7-a09f-5e14-a8af-46152a66caae">here</a></u>.</p><p>For any questions following this notice, please contact our <a href="https://www.gasunietransportservices.nl/en/contact">Shipper Customer Desk</a>.</p>

Low storage levels in Dutch gas storages do not directly endanger security of supply

In response to the current situation, where gas storage is being depleted at a higher rate than expected, Gasunie Transport Services (GTS) presents an interim report. Currently, there is no deterioration in the situation with regards to security of supply of natural gas. However, in the event of a severe winter, a situation with a tight gas supply and possibly high gas prices may arise.
<p>In response to the current situation, where gas storage is being depleted at a higher rate than expected, Gasunie Transport Services (GTS) presents an interim report. Currently, there is no deterioration in the situation with regards to security of supply of natural gas. However, in the event of a severe winter, a situation with a tight gas supply and possibly high gas prices may arise.</p>
						
									<div class="component-block component-paragraph ">
					<h2 class="component-title">Security of supply</h2>
			<div class="ck-editor">
		<p>Although additional gas extraction from storage has been observed since the autumn of 2024, there is still a large volume available in absolute terms. Security of supply is therefore guaranteed. However, a severe winter could lead to a tight supply and higher gas prices in the wholesale market. This could affect costs for households and businesses, depending on developments in the coming months.</p>
	</div>
			</div>
		<div class="component-block component-paragraph ">
					<h2 class="component-title">Storage levels</h2>
			<div class="ck-editor">
		<p>The current fill level of gas storage is lower than observed in recent years. This is due to an extraction rate significantly higher than can be expected based on temperature trends alone. Without this additional extraction, the fill level in the Netherlands would currently be about 15 percentage points higher. Although a similarly low fill level is observed in France, for Europe as a whole, the fill level is comparable to previous years.</p>
	</div>
			</div>
		<div class="component-block component-paragraph ">
					<h2 class="component-title">International and Geopolitical Influences </h2>
			<div class="ck-editor">
		<p>The Netherlands is increasingly dependent on gas imports and a well-functioning European gas market. Developments and uncertainties within the Northwest European region therefore affect the Dutch situation. Currently, there is sufficient gas from LNG imports, gas production in the Netherlands, and adequate supply of gas through pipelines and interconnections. GTS closely monitors the market and sees no direct threat to supply security in the current fill level.</p>

GTS had already put this request on the wish list so that shippers whose nomination system is unavailable have an alternative. This route is not needed as an alternative to the GTS nomination system. GTS' nomination system is duplicated with an automatic fail-over, and partly because of this it has extremely high availability.&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;The TSC and all appendices can be found <a class="intern" href="https://www.gasunietransportservices.nl/en/shipper-trader/terms-and-conditions/tsc">here</a>.

		<p>On gas day November 13, GTS temporarily shut down the Within Day balancing actions (WDBA) system between 6:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m. This was a result of a disruption in the balancing information system due to received incorrect nominations from an external party. This disruption caused a sudden jump in the Portfolio Imbalance Signal (POS) of a number of shippers. The System Balance Signal (SBS) was not affected by this. To prevent the SBS from going outside the dark green zone as a result of shippers taking actions to balance their POS, potentially triggering unjustified balancing actions, the WDBA system was temporarily turned off, as mentioned. We are currently exploring options on how to resolve this issue for the shippers involved. As soon as more is known about this, we will communicate again via a news release.</p><p>In the meantime, the advice remains as usual: shippers should monitor and manage their POS in order to keep their POS in balance.</p><p>Should you have any questions regarding this news item, please contact our <a href="mailto:customerdesk@gastransport.nl">Customer Desk</a>.  </p>

					<h2 class="component-title">The situation may have affected shippers in two ways:</h2>
			<div class="ck-editor">
		<ul><li>As a causer of the balancing action, shipper were faced with an unfavourable price resulting from the balancing action, and/or</li><li>the jump in the POS led shippers to correct their POS (e.g. by selling gas or injecting gas into a storage).</li></ul>
	</div>
			</div>
		<div class="component-block component-paragraph ">
					<h2 class="component-title">1. Unfavourable price of the WDBA</h2>
			<div class="ck-editor">
		<p>As previously communicated via e-mail and the website of GTS, the WDBA was caused by a disruption in the information supply systems. In such situations, article 4.1.4.6 of the Transmission Code Gas - TSO comes into effect. Consequently, the financial settlement of this WDBA has been done in line with article 4.1.4.6 sub 3:<br/></p><p><strong>During a situation in which the information supply system is disrupted, a possible WDM transaction with the causer is settled against the neutral gas price pursuant to 4.1.6.4.</strong></p><p>As a result, we have sent the affected shippers (the causers of the WDBA) two invoices (on 1 October): one regarding the cost of the WDBA (at approximately minus € 1,175 per MWh) and a second one, being a correction invoice in accordance with article 4.1.4.6 sub 3, in which we correct the first invoice by deducting in full the cost of the first invoice and charging these shippers the neutral gas price (€ 35.897 MWh).<br/></p>

					<h2 class="component-title">2. Adjusting the POS</h2>
			<div class="ck-editor">
		<p>During the situation, GTS advised, as usual, to manage their POS adequately. In hindsight we know that the POS of several shippers was affected by the disrupted information supply systems and that the near-realtime (NRT) allocation was not in line with the amount of gas that actually flowed. This will be corrected in the offline allocation data. Differences between NRT and offline allocation data will be settled, as usual, with the neutral gas price of the relevant day. You can expect the settlement invoice regarding the September 24 data as of 4 November 2024.<br/></p>

		<p>GTS is, in general terms, analysing the situation regarding the notable pricing of the WDBA (in this case minus € 1.175 MWh) and is discussing this topic with ICE. Developments regarding the volume, price setting and liquidity of, especially, the Next Hour product are important for the whole market. GTS shall take sufficient time to investigate the cause of the remarkable pricing and work on solutions that will be helpful towards the entire market. At the shipper meeting on 7 November, we hope to give you an update.</p><p>Hopefully we have informed you sufficiently.

			<div class="ck-editor">
		<p><strong><strong>Q: Why does Gasunie use ICE for balancing in the orange zone and not EEX </strong><strong>spot? Is EEX spot not more liquid?</strong></strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> We are aware of the perceived issue with the price forming of the Next Hour product that we use for balancing in the orange zone. We believe that switching to another exchange will not solve this issue, but rather that the poor liquidity has its roots in the nature of the product and the lack of parties who can physically deliver the product, allowing for fairer competition based on cost.</p><p>We are investigating potential solutions and will present our findings in a market session.</p><p><strong>Q: Will the offline allocation settlement have any effect on our POS? </strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> No, an offline allocation settlement is a settlement from a financial perspective only. The settlement is designed to give you a fair price for the amount of gas you had to sell in this case.</p><p><strong>Q: Why should we take action on our POS, even if this is based on disrupted information? </strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> It is a fact that a POS is not always correct, e.g. due to unreliable measurements, however, a POS is never adjusted. The differences between NRT and offline allocation data are settled at the neutral gas price of the day in question.</p><p><strong>Q: Is there a risk that shippers will face exceeding penalties because of this disrupted POS?</strong><strong>A: </strong>No, as mentioned above the offline allocation will be based on the gas that actually flowed. Exceeding invoices are based on the offline allocations, not on the NRT data.  </p>

Analysis on security of gas supply for the 2025-2026 gas year

Today, the official advice on security of gas supply for the 2025-2026 gas year that Gasunie Transport Services (GTS) (100% subsidiary of Gasunie) recently submitted to the Dutch Ministry of Climate Policy and Green Growth was published. GTS concludes that there is sufficient gas supply for the coming gas year but warns of possible shortages in scenarios where a cold winter coincides with low gas availability. The analysis also offers a look ahead to 2030. With the closure of the Groningen field, the Netherlands is now largely dependent on gas imports and well-functioning European markets. Ensuring that the gas storage facilities are sufficiently filled, maintaining sufficient connection capacity with neighbouring countries and diversifying the gas supply are crucial measures for a stable supply of gas over the coming years.

		<p>In its analysis GTS applies three scenarios: a basic variant, a variant with increased gas supply for the Netherlands, and a variant with reduced supply due to limited availability of LNG. In the variant with reduced supply, a cold year would likely see a gas shortage. In its assumptions, GTS assumes the closure of EemsEnergyTerminal and that shortages will continue to arise until after 2030. Under the current assumptions, the volume shortage is less than previously reported. However, to ensure security of supply GTS believes it is important to maintain the existing supply.  </p><p><strong>Capacity and volume balance</strong><br/>The capacity balance (with peak demand) shows a limited shortage in a situation that statistically occurs once every 20 years. The volume balance (average demand for the entire gas year) only shows shortages in the variant with reduced supply and cold weather. The role of international gas flows is becoming increasingly important in this respect, in terms of keeping supply and demand in balance. </p><p><strong>Gas storage facilities</strong><br/>With the closure of the Groningen field and the fall in the supply of Russian gas, gas storage facilities in the Netherlands have taken on a crucial role. GTS advises that the gas storage facilities be filled with at least 110 TWh (approx. 11bcm) by the start of the winter of 2025-2026. This level is necessary to absorb seasonal fluctuations in gas demand, primarily in the Netherlands but also in neighbouring countries supplied via the Netherlands. In addition to well filled gas storage facilities, to further guarantee security of supply GTS emphasises the importance of the connection capacity with neighbouring countries and diversification of supply.<br/><br/><strong>Additional reserve</strong><br/>GTS based its advice on realistic assumptions and consulted market parties as regards these assumptions. However, the various scenarios do not take into account major or long-term disruptions, like the problems with Nord Stream in 2022 and the Baltic Interconnector in 2023. Additional measures are still necessary for this. With the closure of the Groningen field, the Netherlands can now only compensate for long-term disruptions with gas supplied from a gas storage facility.  Gas storage in existing seasonal storage facilities would be a logical option for securing additional reserves.</p>
