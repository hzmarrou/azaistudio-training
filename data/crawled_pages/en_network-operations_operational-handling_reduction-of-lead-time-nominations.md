The EASEE-
gas
Common Business Practices advise a the lead time for transport nominations of 2 full clock hours (H-2). This 2 hours is more or less the European standard lead time and enables the TSO to arrange its transport
system
to be prepared for changes.
The EASEE-
gas
Common Business Practices advise a lead time for transport nominations of 2 full clock hours (H-2). This 2-
hour
period is more or less the European standard lead time and enables the TSO to arrange its transport
system
to be prepared for changes.
GTS
has investigated under which conditions and at which interconnection points it is possible to reduce the 2-
hour
nomination
lead time. This gives commercial parties more flexibility to keep their
portfolio
in balance and a shorter lead time also fits in better with the existing balancing
system
applied by
GTS
. For that purpose,
GTS
has contacted a large number of NNOs (production facilities, storage operators and industrial customers) about the operational and administrative possibilities. The following lead times have been agreed for use by
GTS
:
Border points 2 hours (in line      with EASEE-)
Industrial      customers: 30 mins
Storage      operators: 30 mins (*)
Production      facilities: 30 mins (*)
(*) At some specific storage and production points, it is not possible to reduce the lead time due to limitations in the network or it is the wish of the
NNO
to stick to a 2-
hour
nomination
lead time.

Certain conditions have to be met for nominations at interconnection points with a 30-minute lead time; Large changes in the short term especially can result in problems in the network. For that reason, the following rules apply for network points with a
capacity
over 1,000,000 kWh/h:
The difference between the
nomination
known at H-2 and the
nomination
received between H-2 and H-½      should not be more than 25% of the
capacity
. A change of max.      1,000,000 kWh/h compared to the previous
nomination
is always allowed (of      course, insofar as acceptable for the
contracted capacity
);
For      bidirectional  for which a
Shipper
has      booked  in both directions, the highest value of the firm      booked entry and
exit capacity
is determined first. The      max. acceptable difference (25%) is based on the highest value.
If a party would like to have a lead time of ½
hour
at a
connection point
which currently does not offer this option, he should contact our
Customer Desk
.
GTS
will check whether or not lead time reduction is possible and contact the
NNO
involved. Together they will investigate whether or not a reduction of the lead time is possible.
GTS
will inform the party about the results and, if a reduction is possible, about the starting date of the reduction.
