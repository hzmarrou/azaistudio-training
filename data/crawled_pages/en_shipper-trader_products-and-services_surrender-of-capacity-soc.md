Surrender of
Capacity
(SoC) is a
CMP measure
that offers shippers the opportunity to return their
capacity
to
GTS
.
GTS
will offer this
capacity
again in the auction at the PRISMA platform.
Capacity
returned by shippers will only be sold after
GTS
has sold its own technically
available capacity
. During the auction, the returned
capacity
can not be distinguished from regular
GTS
capacity
.
The returning
shipper
remains the owner of the
capacity
as long as the
capacity
has not been resold. The
capacity
offered via a SoC request cannot be used on the
secondary market
(for example Transfer of
Capacity
or Usage Rights or Diversion) until the relevant auction has ended. If the surrendered
capacity
is not sold, the
shipper
will have full access to it again.
In case the returned
capacity
has been sold (in whole or in part) to a new
shipper
, the returning
shipper
is released from its payment obligation for the part sold.
All returned
capacity
is auctioned at a virtual
interconnection point
(VIP) regardless of whether the original contract is at a virtual or a regular
interconnection point
. Unsold returned
capacity
remains at the (virtual or regular)
interconnection point
on which the contract is located.
After the auction, the returning
shipper
will be notified by
GTS
by email of the status of the SoC request.
GTS
does not charge any additional fees for submitting a SoC request.
Other information
Because      the
CMP
rules apply to the return of bundled
capacity
, a      SoC can result in contracts being split, leaving a
shipper
with      unbundled
capacity
. For example, if a
shipper
returns bundled
capacity
to      be auctioned and
GTS
still has (technical)
capacity
available but      the
NNO
does not,
GTS
will sell its own (technical)
capacity
while the
NNO
sells the returned
capacity
. This results in a (partial)      splitting of a contract for bundled
capacity
.
SoC      is only allowed for
contracted capacity
without any restrictions.      A SoC is not possible if additional terms apply (e.g.
capacity
under      construction in the event of an Open Season contract.) A
shipper
can only      return
capacity
if he has both
capacity
and usage rights.
SoC      is possible for Yearly, Quarterly or Monthly auctions with firm forward      flow. SoC is also possible for Monthly auctions of firm
capacity
in the counter flow direction. SoC does not apply to
interruptible capacity
and/or day-ahead and within-day auctions.
Submitting      a SoC request is subject to a deadline. For Yearly, Quarterly and Monthly      auctions, the request must have been successfully processed at least 5      working days before the publication of the auction on PRISMA. The      deadlines for submission can be found in
the      auction calendar
on the
GTS
website.
A      SoC request requires a flat profile.
Each      SoC request is given a unique SoC timestamp. SoC
capacity
offered at      auction is sold in order of timestamp (from old to new) per network point.
