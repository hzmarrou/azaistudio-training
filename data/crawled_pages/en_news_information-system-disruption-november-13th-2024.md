On
gas day
November 13,
GTS
temporarily shut down the Within Day balancing actions (WDBA)
system
between 6:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m. This was a result of a disruption in the balancing information
system
due to received incorrect nominations from an external party. This disruption caused a sudden jump in the
Portfolio Imbalance Signal
(POS) of a number of shippers. The
System Balance Signal
(SBS) was not affected by this. To prevent the SBS from going outside the
dark green zone
as a result of shippers taking actions to balance their POS, potentially triggering unjustified balancing actions, the WDBA
system
was temporarily turned off, as mentioned. We are currently exploring options on how to resolve this issue for the shippers involved. As soon as more is known about this, we will communicate again via a news release.
In the meantime, the advice remains as usual: shippers should monitor and manage their POS in order to keep their POS in balance.
