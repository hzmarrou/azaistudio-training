Dear
customer
,
The energy market and the
gas
market in particular are in a constant state of flux. Already Europe’s largest
gas
trading hub, TTF continues to attract new parties to its trading platform, and
gas
transport in the Netherlands has not been stagnant either. Wherever necessary and possible, we adapt our services accordingly. With this newsletter, we want to update you on the latest changes and developments.
We see great value in personal contact, which is why we will be at the
E-world
trade show again this year with our own stand, where we hope to see you. On top of that, we will continue to organise in-person sessions to discuss a wide array of market-related topics with you. Obviously, you can also put any questions you may have to us through our
Customer Desk
.
On our website and Gasport, you can access both general information and information that is specific to you. Further improving information delivery is something that has our full attention and where we recently reached out to you to join our thought process. The response we got from you showed real commitment to this particular subject, for which we would like to thank you. We will brief you on specific developments in this area later.
This newsletter will go into a number of current topics that we have grouped together into four categories: general information, advice on
gas
production from the Groningen field, the latest on
gas
transport services, and an update on terms and conditions, regulation and tariffs.
If you have any questions that are not answered in this newsletter, feel free to contact our
Customer Desk
. We will be happy to help.
Enjoy reading our newsletter!

Customer
Services Manager
E-world 2023 – 23 t/m 25 mei
From 23 to 25 May, we will be at the E-world trade show in Essen, Germany. We would like to welcome you at our very own stand in Hall 2 to engage with you and answer any questions you may have.
If you would like, you can even make an appointment in advance. We will soon be sending out an email with an appointment form so that you can let us know on what date and at what time you would like to talk to us and what you would like to talk to us about.
We look forward to meeting you at E-world 2023!
Survey on the future
GTS
customer
portal: MyGTS
At the market session held on 24 November 2022, we announced that we would be conducting a survey around the new MyGTS portal.
MyGTS is set to become the successor to the Gasport
customer
portal. The idea behind the survey is to be able to better meet your needs, while at the same time making processes run more efficiently. We asked for your input at the market session.
We subsequently sent out a questionnaire in January, seeking your feedback on five proposals that could be implemented in MyGTS. There was also an opportunity for you to provide separate input on features that you would like to see on the portal in the future. Your feedback showed that you welcome our proposals on
customer
data management,
nomination
management, and management of exposure within the credit limit.
Our next step now is to conduct impact analyses of these proposed features. We will keep you posted on further
customer
portal developments.
We are grateful to everyone who provided input; it was very valuable for us.
Licence developments in 2022
In 2022, twenty new licences were issued. Most of these licences are A licences, i.e. for access to TTF and physical
gas
transport, followed by C licences for TTF access only, and finally B licences for access to TTF, physical
gas
transport, and
supply
to a regional network.
In that same year, fourteen licences were terminated, either at the
shipper
’s request or due to prolonged inactivity.
All in all, the number of licences has gone up slightly.
Check our website for the
Licence list
with the most recent status of all the licences and developments over time.
Advice on the amount of Groningen
gas
needed for security of
supply
in the 2023/2024
gas
year
Every year,
GTS
advises the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy on how much
gas
will be needed from the Groningen
gas
field to ensure security of
supply
in the upcoming
gas
year. Based on analyses, we have concluded that the
capacity
of all the current Groningen
gas
production sites will be needed to be able to guarantee security of
supply
in the 2023/2024
gas
year. This also means that our advice is to not implement the proposed decision to close several production sites this April. For the current
gas
year, it means that we advised the ministry to raise the Groningen
gas
production cap from 2.8 to 3.2 bcm. For the next
gas
year, our advice is to keep all eleven production sites open and continue to allow the associated minimum flow of 3.2 bcm. In addition, we advise maintaining the ‘back-up volume,’ i.e. the volume of
gas
that can be extracted from the Groningen field in acute emergency situations, at 1.5 bcm.
Changing conditions in the energy market
Over the past years, many parties have worked hard to implement measures intended to reduce
gas
extraction from the Groningen field, with a view to ultimately closing the field as soon as possible.  Several such measures, such as scaling up pseudo-G-
gas
production using additional base-load nitrogen and procured nitrogen, have meanwhile been completed.  A series of other measures are still in the process of being implemented, such as switching households in Belgium, France and Germany from L-
gas
to H-
gas
, switching the Netherlands’ nine largest industrial consumers from using only G-
gas
to using mainly H-
gas
, construction of the Zuidbroek II nitrogen installation for additional pseudo-G-
gas
production, and switching the Grijpskerk
gas storage facility
to G-
gas
.  These were all factors in the advice we issued in January 2022, which included the projection that the earliest possible date for final closure of the Groningen
gas
field could be 1 October 2023.
However, the situation in the Dutch and European energy market changed radically following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. While, until recently, roughly a third of all H-
gas
supplied to north-western Europe came from Russia, the
supply
of H-
gas
to north-western Europe has stopped completely since the summer, causing shortages that pushed up prices and ultimately led to reduced demand for
gas
. The gap in
gas
supplies resulting from the cessation of Russian
gas
imports was partly made up by importing additional volumes of Liquefied Natural
Gas
(LNG) through terminals in Belgium, the Netherlands, and the UK. However, these volumes of LNG are not enough to fully replace all the
gas
that used to be imported from Russia. This is having major consequences for energy
supply
in the Netherlands.
Prior to the loss of H-
gas
imports from Russia, the available H-
gas
supply
was enough to meet demand for H-
gas
in full while also facilitating maximum pseudo-G/L-
gas
production. As a result, our analysis to estimate Groningen
gas
needs had to look only at the
supply
/demand balance in the G/L-
gas
market, and did not have to look at the H-
gas
market at all.  Currently, however, H-
gas
supplies are insufficient to be able to serve both markets fully. We have, therefore, recalibrated the basic premises for the analyses for security of
supply
and taken the radically changed
supply
/demand situation as our starting point. Given the major uncertainty in today’s energy markets, we have worked out the implications of a large number of possible scenarios. Our analysis shows that there are scenarios conceivable where the minimum flow would suffice to ensure security of
supply
. However, there are many uncertainties in the assumptions on both the
supply
side and the demand side, where setbacks are more likely than windfalls, unfortunately. In such scenarios with setbacks, minimum flow from the Groningen
gas
field will not suffice to guarantee security of
supply
.
We keep tracking developments in the
gas
market on an ongoing basis. It is important that we do, especially now, because the whole of Europe is facing
gas
shortages and taking measures to solve these shortages as soon as possible. These measures include the various LNG initiatives in Germany and the Netherlands. Should the above developments lead to changes in the planning principles and impact the projected required Groningen
gas
production for the 2023/2024
gas
year, we will inform the State Secretary.

Implementation of Edig@s version 6.1
In the course of 2023, we will be implementing Edig@s version 6.1 within the
nomination
and matching process.
From that moment onwards, our shippers can
switch
from Edig@s version 4.0 or 5.1 to version 6.1 for their electronic communications with
GTS
. The
switch
will be made in consultation with the shippers, the service providers, and
Nomination
Support.
After a transitional period, Edig@s version 4.0 will be phased out and no longer be supported.  For more information about Edig@s, visit https://www.edigas.org/.
Phase-out of
nomination
/matching emails
Besides formal electronic Edig@s communications, we provide an additional service to some of the shippers by sending them automated emails with information from the
nomination
and matching process. Since this information is or can also be sent in Edig@s XML messages, we intend to phase out this additional service and fully
switch
to electronic Edig@s communication.
The plan is to start later this year. Specific information on how long it will take will follow later. The automated emails that will be sent via Edig@s from then on are the Interruption Notice and the Message Processing Result (MPR).

PRISMA auctions: offering
interruptible capacity
after
capacity
conversion
Over the past year, there were several occasions where fixed
capacity
on a certain network point sold out completely at a Day-Ahead auction, without this triggering an auction for
interruptible capacity
. This is due to the fact that shippers can submit a
capacity
conversion request during the fixed
capacity
auction, thus creating combined
capacity
and limited fixed
capacity
becoming available on our side after the auction. Seeing as we are only allowed to auction
interruptible capacity
when all fixed
capacity
has sold out, the auction for
interruptible capacity
cannot be launched.
Although this phenomenon occurred only a few times, it led to unexpected and unwanted situations every time, especially in shippers’
portfolio
planning.
GTS
has meanwhile made a number of technical changes to prevent this unwanted situation from occurring again in the future. Thanks to these changes, a
capacity
conversion request will no longer affect whether or not an auction for DA
interruptible capacity
is started. The fixed
capacity
that may be freed up due to a conversion will be offered for sale at the next WiD auction on that day.
Publication of aggregations on ENTSOG Transparency Platform
In order to better facilitate the energy transition and the market, we have amended a number of publications on the ENTSOG Transparency Platform by supplying aggregate data on a more detailed level.
The following changes took effect on 1 July 2022:
The aggregation with Production Points has been split up into:
-  Production
-  Green
gas
production
The aggregation with Industry Points has been split up into:
-  Industry L-
gas
-  Industry H-
gas
-  Power plants L-
gas
-  Power plants H-
gas
The aggregations with RNO and PNO points have been merged and subsequently split up into:
-  LDC points L-
gas
-  LDC points H-
gas
ACM publishes draft decision on the prevention of unwanted balancing tactics
Our regulator, ACM, recently published a draft decision to make the following changes to the
Gas
Transmission
Code for the
network operator
of the national
transmission
network:
Definition of what constitutes unwanted balancing tactics
Requirement for
GTS
to charge programme-responsible parties whenever they use such tactics
Stakeholders can submit their views on the proposed decision to ACM before they make a final decision. The deadline for responses is 9 April 2023.
For details, see the
ACM website
Capacity
for LNG
connection
requests
We have received multiple
connection
requests for LNG entry into the national
gas
transmission
network. In total, approximately 26 to 29GW of
entry capacity
has been requested. The projects of the various requesting parties are in different stages of development.
We are currently finishing our analysis of the extent to which we can accommodate the requested entry capacities in our network, which has thus far shown that with limited investment we can provide a considerable amount of
entry capacity
.
GTS
intends to start offering the abovementioned
capacity
on the market from 3 July, coinciding with the next annual auction for transport
capacity
at border points. The applicable procedure will be announced on 5 June.
Capacity
will be offered both at the existing GATE
entry point
and at a number of new virtual entry points. This way, all
GTS
-recognised shippers are enabled to contract this existing
capacity
for LNG projects that are under development without needing to have a
physical connection
in place already.
State of play on security of
supply
Partly thanks to the mild winter, the construction of several new LNG terminals, and high fill levels at
gas
storage facilities, there is enough
gas
available in Europe this winter. While prices did fall sharply thanks to these favourable developments, they are still higher than they were before the
gas
crisis started. The combination of high
gas
prices and the mild winter led to market demand shrinking by 20-25%. Where the Netherlands used to consume around 370 TWh of
gas
before the
gas
crisis, consumption has now fallen to around 293 TWh on an annual basis.
Given that H-
gas
supplies are still limited, we now need to convert the primarily price-driven demand reduction into a permanent reduction by insulating more homes and buildings.
It is key that
gas
storage facilities reach a fill level of at least 90% again before the start of next winter (1 November 2023). For the Bergermeer facility, this will be achieved partly thanks to incentives offered by the Dutch government.
However, a situation where we do not have enough
gas
to
supply
all consumers, ranging from industry to households, cannot be ruled out, which is why the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy is further working out the specifics of the measures from the
Gas Protection and Recovery Plan
. The methodology the ministry has in mind is described in a
letter to Dutch Parliament
. In summary, the letter explains that, in the event of
gas
shortages,
gas
supply
to high-volume users will gradually be reduced until there is sufficient
gas
left for all remaining consumers.
Interruptible capacity
cap
The introduction of NC TAR brought one flat-rate tariff for
interruptible capacity
and switched the
capacity
volume to infinite.
Interruptible capacity
is (automatically) offered at the
capacity
auction on PRISMA as soon as the fixed
available capacity
sells out.
Due to the very high spread between NBP and TTF in 2022, unusually large volumes of
capacity
were sold on one specific network point (VIP-BENE), which led to a high degree of interruption and a high discount on
interruptible capacity
from 2024.
In order to provide a good representation of
interruptible capacity
as a product,
GTS
will cap
interruptible capacity
at 20% of the
technical capacity
as and when fixed
capacity
sells out at the PRISMA auction. The date for implementation of the cap is 1 April 2023.
Addendum to the Investment Plan (2022IP)
We will be subjecting an addendum to the Investment Plan (2022IP) to a four-week consultation period from April. In this addendum, we will describe a number of proposed investments that were not included in the 2022 Investment Plan.
After the consultation period, we will process the responses received and submit the addendum to ACM and the Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy. They will then assess the draft addendum within the statutory term of twelve weeks, following which we will adopt the final addendum.
Energy Act update
For some time now, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy has been working on a bill for the new Energy Act, which brings together the
Gas
Act and the Electricity Act into one piece of legislation.
The Energy Act serves to implement the new EU regulation on the internal market for electricity while also giving substance to national policy objectives, like those stated in the Dutch Climate Agreement. Although the changes are less drastic for
gas
than they are for electricity, the Energy Act will nevertheless also have consequences for
gas
network users and
gas
network operators.
Following the Council of State’s advice on the bill, which they issued in February 2023, the ball is now in the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy’s court to decide how to address the points of criticism and concerns raised in the Council of State’s advice before submitting the bill to the House of Representatives. The Energy Act is not likely to come into force before 2024.
MFF and BAS – MFFBAS
In order to effectively share energy data with input from all (market) parties involved, the Market Facilitation Forum (MFF) and Beheerder Afsprakensstelsel B.V. (BAS) were merged into MFFBAS in April 2022.
The MFF is geared towards consultations with stakeholders to reach the agreements needed for effective, efficient, and reliable electronic data sharing for both
system
processes and data sharing processes. The MFF is an association that any party operating in the energy industry in the Netherlands can join to take part in the conversation and decision-making on energy data sharing.
BAS is responsible for facilitation of data sharing and providing access to data sharing processes. BAS engages with the parties involved to reach agreements on energy data sharing and manages these agreements. BAS takes care of practical support for the MFF association.
The idea is to make energy data more broadly accessible, so as to enable households and industry to get smarter in their energy usage. Privacy protection and not sharing commercially sensitive information are crucial preconditions in this respect.
During the first phase of its existence, MFFBAS has focused strongly on setting up processes that will lead to agreements, implementing the agreements made, and reaching agreements on identification, authentication, and authorisation for access to energy data. MFFBAS has also taken on a number of tasks that used to be handled by NEDU, such as the Allocation 2.0 programme, the management of usage profiles, and the publication of sector documentation.

Auctions Regulation – Overbooking and buy-back (OBB)
On 19 December 2022, the European council adopted the proposed Council Regulation (EU) 2022/2576 - enhancing solidarity through better coordination of
gas
purchases, reliable price benchmarks and exchanges of
gas
across borders.
One part of this regulation that is particularly relevant to
GTS
network users is article 14. This article is intended to make sure that all
transmission capacity
that is sold is also actually used, so as to maximise
gas
flows between the various market areas during the current
gas
crisis.
What this article basically boils down to is that it makes it compulsory to introduce some kind of firm day-ahead use-it-or-lose-it (UIOLI) mechanism, whereby the TSO has to offer any unused
contracted capacity
to the market again on a monthly or daily basis. Application of this mechanism is not conditional on contractual and/or
physical congestion
at the border point in question. The mechanism will automatically enter into force on 1 April 2023.
Paragraph 7 of article 14 provides an exception for situations where the TSO has already implemented one of the
CMP
measures listed there. As far back as in 2014, we already implemented, in close consultation with the Dutch regulator (ACM), an overbooking and buy-back mechanism as specified under b in paragraph 7, meaning that we already auction unused fixed
capacity
at all border points.  Combined with the fact that we also auction
interruptible capacity
on a daily basis, this ensures that all the
available capacity
can actually be used by network users.
Based on the above,
GTS
will not be under an obligation to implement the new short-term UIOLI mechanism as defined in article 14.
PRISMA Platform – bookings
Over the past few months, we have seen rising short-term
capacity
sales on the PRISMA Platform (concerning FCFS).
In nearly all cases, messaging between PRISMA and
GTS
is flawless. Shippers receive
confirmation
of their booking in a matter of minutes.
Sometimes, however, PRISMA returns an error message when a
shipper
places a booking. PRISMA then goes black or there is another kind of fault during the
capacity
booking process. If that happens, do not immediately assume your booking was aborted. Despite the error message or fault, your booking may still have been recorded successfully.
So be sure to check our
customer
portal first to see if the booking has gone ahead despite the error message.
This way, you will prevent multiple bookings from being registered for the same
capacity
, while it will also save you and us troubleshooting time.
We are working with PRISMA to solve this problem.
