The LFS service aims to provide an incentive for shippers to be in balance at the end of the
gas day
. Shippers use this LFS service and pay a fee for it when they are not balanced at the end of the gasday and thereby use the network buffer.
The LFS service uses the flexibility of the network buffer. This is represented by the
dark green zone
at
GTS
. If, at the end of the
gas day
, the SBS is in the
dark green zone
,
GTS
has sufficient pipeline buffer available and the shippers who are not in balance will automatically make use of the new LFS service. Through this service, shippers will pay for the use of the network buffer at the end of the
gas day
.
How does the LFS work?
The basic principle is that the SBS is in the
dark green zone
at the end of the
gas day
. Shippers who have an imbalance at the end of the day, hence a POS other than 0, will use the network buffer. These shippers will either have a shortage or a surplus of
gas
, which will be absorbed by the network’s buffer function. The use of the buffer function is called the LFS and is subject to a tariff.
Booking or
nomination
is not required.
GTS
applies the POS at 06:00 hours (LET) and calls that the use of the LFS. For 2023, the LFS tariff is 0.4% of the neutral
gas
price. The percentage can be adjusted on the basis of an evaluation. The
shipper
’s POS remains, in other words no
gas
is exchanged between shippers and
GTS
.
Example: an 06:00 hours POS of 1,000 MWh short will cost the
shipper
1000 MWh x 0.4% x neutral
gas
price €/MWh.
Invoicing will take place after the end of each month. A new screen is generated in Gasport with a transparent overview of the usage and costs for shippers.
