Suppliers deliver
gas
to customers in the regional grid of the
Distribution
System
Operators (DSO) in the various
customer
categories (
large-scale user
and
small-scale user
).
Suppliers also deliver
gas
to
directly connected parties
who are connected to the
Gasunie Transport Services
(
GTS
) grid.
If a market party wants to become active as a
supplier
in the
distribution network
, it has to register with EDSN via
Partners in Energie
. If the market party also wants to become active as a
supplier
for small-scale users (including households), a
supply license
also has to be obtained from
ACM
.
EDSN sends a message to market parties, including
GTS
, when a
supplier
has completed the registration process.
GTS
will then request the
supplier
to fill in a
Supplier
Registration form in order to register the
supplier
with
GTS
. This is necessary to ensure correct messaging  in which the
EAN code
of the
supplier
is an essential part and for the delivery to small-scale users in the
distribution network
, for the invoicing of Peak
Supply
.
The
supplier
always has a relation with a
shipper
. The
shipper
buys and delivers the
gas
to the
supplier
. When a market party wants to become active as a
supplier
for directly connected parties to the
GTS
grid, this market party has to register at
GTS
as a
supplier
.
