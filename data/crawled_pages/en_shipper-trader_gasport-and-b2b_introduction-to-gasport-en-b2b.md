GTS
makes information available to its customers with regard to the transport of
gas
via our Online services. The content of this information is mainly depending on your role within the transport of
gas
(
shipper
,
end user
,
supplier
or other
network user
).
You can retrieve this information in 2 ways:
Gasport
: A portal, providing web-based access to transport information. In this way      you can view, via screens, the information relevant and available for you;
B2B (Business to Business): B2B makes it possible to download information and integrate it in      your
system
. This service provides interfaces based on web service      technology to retrieve information (XML downloads).
Due to the role of shippers within the balancing regime of the
national grid
shippers with license A or B have to make use of B2B, because the infrastructure of B2B is 24-
hour
service based. Shippers with licence A, B or C have to make use of Gasport that is only serviced by
GTS
during office hours.

In addition to near real time information, we also provide historical information. This historical information includes the archived near real time information, but also the offline allocations used in the settlement process and invoicing. In principle offline data is the same data as near real time data, but extra checks and, if needed, corrections have been made to it.
