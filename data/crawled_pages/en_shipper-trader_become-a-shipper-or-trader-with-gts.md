Which licenses do we know?
If you meet these conditions for recognition, you can be regarded as a recognised party by
GTS
and you will receive a licence.
A Licence: You need this type of licence if you want to physically transport
gas
in the
national grid
. You can also trade on the
TTF
with this licence. We will then refer to you as a ‘
Shipper
’.
B Licence: You need this type of licence if you want to transport
gas
to a transfer point with a local
gas
transport network. This licence also gives you access to all the activities that a
shipper
with an A licence may carry out. We will also refer to you as a ‘
Shipper
’ when you have a B licence.
C Licence: You need this type of licence if you only want to trade
gas
on the
TTF
. We will then refer to you as a ‘Trader’.

How long will it take to get a licence?
How long the licensing process will take depends on several factors. These factors include how successful the communication tests are, the creditworthiness analysis and provision of the required documents (for these, see the
conditions for recognition
).  You should allow for an average turnaround time of four to six months.
If the licensing process takes longer than 180 days, some documents will have to be resubmitted.
Once you have obtained a licence, you will be added to our
licence list
. You can also indicate whether you want to be added to the
list of registered TTF users
.
How much does it cost to get a licence?
There are no costs associated with obtaining a licence and we will not send you a bill. Of course, you will have to bear the costs of any measures you have to take to meet the conditions for obtaining a licence.
If I want to transport gas to an industry, do I need an LB licence?
No
Why do I have to provide a copy of my ID card?
Because Gasunie has a legitimate interest in protecting the market and itself against future attempts of fraud. Therefore, effective verification of a person’s identity has to take place in which we want to assure that the person actually is the person that he or she says to be. Of all potential new customers a copy of a valid ID card will be requested, but make sure that the picture and national identification number are not visible. You can use the ‘KopieID’ app from the Dutch Government to provide the copy without the photo and national identification service number, but you can also do this yourself. Gasunie will not accept copies of an ID card where the photo and a national identification number are visible!
GTS
will store the copy of the ID-card until one year after the licence is withdrawn. The request complies with the rules of the GDPR. If you have any questions or remarks concerning our request please contact
[email protected]
