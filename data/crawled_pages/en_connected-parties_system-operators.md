After first supplying the domestic market with
gas
from reserves that had been discovered, the
network
soon began to play another essential role in cross-border
gas
exports to Germany and Belgium as well as France, Switzerland and Italy.
With the discovery of offshore
gas
in the North Sea, not only on the Dutch Continental Shelf but also in Norway and later Denmark, the network has come to play an important role in making this
gas
available to the Dutch and European markets.
GTS
is also still involved in the
small fields policy
.
Liberalisation of the
gas
market means that the
transmission
network has continued to develop and there are now multiple connections with
gas
storage facilities, an
interconnector
with the United Kingdom and LNG terminals.
Europe is becoming increasingly dependent on external, non-European
gas
imports. LNG plays an important part in this. The European
gas
market is becoming part of the global
gas
market. Good interconnections with the UK (and other countries) and direct connections to LNG terminals means that the
GTS
network is well connected to the global
gas
market.
Over the years,
GTS
has developed many
gas
-
transmission
-related
products and services
; these promote
gas
trading and support connected
system
operators in offering services based on their installations. The
GTS
network has traditionally been well connected to European
gas
markets and being connected to its network via the
TTF
provides direct access to continental Europe’s most liquid
gas
market, for both the prompt and the forward market. The flexibility inherent in the
gas
transmission
network made available to the market in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner is one of the reasons the TTF is so liquid and so attractive to traders.
