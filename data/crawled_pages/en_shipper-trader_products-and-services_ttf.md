The TTF (Title Transfer Facility) is a virtual transfer point within
GTS
’s national
gas
transport network. In other words, a network point where we offer market parties the opportunity to transfer
gas
that is already present in our
system
(‘entry-paid
gas
’) to another party. It is a simple process for
gas
brought into the
national grid
through an
entry point
to change ownership via the TTF before it leaves the
national grid
at an
exit point
.
Being able to transfer
gas
easily promotes
gas
trading. The virtual network point TTF can serve as an
entry point
in the
portfolio
of a
shipper
or trader who buys
gas
and as an
exit point
in the
portfolio
of a
shipper
or trader who sells
gas
.
GTS
registers the transfer of
gas
via the virtual network point TTF through a ‘
nomination
’. This is an electronic message stating the volume of
gas
transferred, the time period and the buyer and seller. Any
shipper
or trader approved by
GTS
can transfer
gas
through the transfer point, TTF.
Many national and international parties are active in the Dutch
gas
sector, such as
gas
producers,
gas
storage operators, network operators and
gas
distribution
companies. The launch of the TTF in the Netherlands has created a major trading hub for buying or selling
gas
within the Dutch market area.
When the TTF was set up in 2003, this led to huge growth in
gas
trading in a single marketplace, significantly increasing
gas
trading liquidity. The volume of
gas
traded using the TTF as its transfer point has grown substantially in recent years and this volume is now the largest in Europe. TTF
gas
trades account for more than eighty times the volume of
gas
consumed in the Netherlands.
Gas
prices in the Dutch market area, made transparent through exchanges and data publishing agencies, have become important reference prices in Europe.
How does the TTF operate
Parties wanting to trade in
gas
find each other one on one, through a broker or via a
gas
exchange. If the traded
gas
is to flow into our network, a
nomination
must be submitted to
GTS
. This means we always know who owns the
gas
in our
system
. We do not need to be notified of transactions via the TTF where the traded
gas
will not flow into our network (financial settlement cases).
Gas
exchange
A
gas
exchange allows a
shipper
or trader to buy or sell
gas
through the TTF without the other party to the
gas
transfer being known to the
shipper
or trader. The
gas
exchange brings together the volumes of
gas
offered and the volumes of
gas
requested and processes the financial transactions. If the
gas
trade takes place on a
gas
exchange, the
gas
exchange will take care of the TTF
nomination
for the
shipper
. This involves nominating the balance of all transactions between the
gas
exchange and the
shipper
or trader.
At the current time, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy has appointed two companies as
gas
exchange operators for the Dutch
gas
market, i.e. ICE Endex Markets B.V. (ICE) en Energy Exchange AG (EEX).
See the section

shipper
and obtaining a licence.
