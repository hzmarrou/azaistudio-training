A diversion allows shippers transfer
transmission capacity
contracted on an entry or
exit point
to a different entry or
exit point
at the same location, on the condition that it does not require extra
transmission capacity
.
Below you will find further explanation of diversions and the diversion procedure. The formal rules for a diversion are laid down in Article 2.1.7 of the
Transmission Code Gas TSO
.
How can I apply for a diversion?
You can request a diversion by submitting the diversion request form. Make sure you send the completed and signed form, in PDF format, to the
Customer Desk
on time. A diversion cannot be requested on PRISMA. Diversions are available only for
firm capacity
.

Between which network points can I divert
capacity
?
We offer the diversion service for various combinations between virtual interconnection points (‘VIP’) and domestic points (‘FCFS’), i.e. from FCFS to FCFS, from VIP to FCFS, from VIP to VIP, and from FCFS to VIP. The full list of combinations can be found in Appendix 3 of the applicable
TSC
.
Since the introduction of
VIPs
on 1 April 2020,
capacity
can no longer be diverted  from or to an
interconnection point
(‘IP’). If you want to divert
capacity
away from an IP to another network point (through FCFS or VIP), you will first have to transfer this
capacity
to the relevant VIP. You can do this using the VIP transfer service. Details of the VIP transfer service are available on our
website
.
Both in terms of the procedure and the tariff, a diversion to a VIP is subject to different rules compared with a diversion to a FCFS network point. We will go into this in greater detail in the following. The different rules are a result of the difference between Article 2.1.7.3 (diversion to a VIP) and Article 2.1.7.4 (diversion to an FCFS network point) in the
Transmission
Code.
Whenever you submit a diversion request, we will inform you of the results. As soon as the diversion has been registered contractually, you will receive an email
confirmation
with details of your contract positions in Gasport.
Procedure and tariff for FCFS-FCFS and VIP-FCFS diversions (Article 2.1.7.4)
A request for an FCFS-FCFS or VIP-FCFS diversion must be submitted to
GTS
using the above form. Please make sure we have the completed and signed form at least 10 working days before the requested diversion start date. If the requested
capacity
is available on the FCFS target network point, we will divert the
capacity
from the source network point to the target network point. For these kinds of diversions, you will be charged the highest of the two tariffs for the network points in question (
transmission
tariff and from 2021 also the neutrality charge). For this kind of diversion (to an FCFS network point), the type of
capacity
product on the source network point is taken into consideration.
To illustrate, the tariff of an entry VIP - FCFS (
gas
storage) diversion for the months of January and July 2021 from a yearly contract for 2021. For the tariffs used for each
capacity
product, check the ‘Total prices’ tab of Appendix 1 of the current TSC for 2021. All tariffs in this example have been rounded to two decimal places.
For      the capacities on the source network point for both the months in      question, the tariff is €0.15/kWh/h (€1.80/kWh/h multiplied by the term of      31/365).
The      tariff for the same months in a new yearly contract for the target network      point is €0.06/kWh/h (€0.72/kWh/h multiplied by the term of 31/365).
A      diversion cannot lead to a
shipper
paying a lower price for
capacity
than initially contracted. Even though a discount is given on the      target network point because it is a
gas storage facility
, the      higher tariff of €0.15/kWh/h will be payable for the
capacity
transferred.
Even      though a monthly product for January 2021 is subject to a higher tariff of      €0.16/kWh/h, we do not have to charge this tariff for this type of      diversion (to an FCFS point).
You      will not be charged on the source network point for the diverted
capacity
.
VIP-FCFS and FCFS-FCFS diversions can be contracted for daily, monthly, quarterly and yearly
capacity
products, not for within-day products.
Procedure for VIP-VIP and FCFS-VIP diversions (Article 2.1.7.3)
A request for a VIP-VIP and FCFS-VIP diversion must be submitted to
GTS
before the auction. Please make sure we have the completed and signed form at least 10 working days before the start of the auction at which you intend to contract the
capacity
you want to divert. It will then be up to you to contract the
capacity
you want to divert at the auction on the target VIP. After you have contracted this
capacity
, we can further process your diversion request. If the
capacity
you were able to contract at the auction is less than the
capacity
you intended to divert, we will limit the diversion to that lower contracted quantity.
After the auction, we will reduce the
capacity
to be diverted at the source network point. For the diversion, you will be charged the reserve price (and from 2021 also the neutrality charge) of the
capacity
product you bought at the auction. If the auction is subject to an auction premium, you will of course also be charged that premium. Again, the diversion cannot lead to a
shipper
paying a lower price for
capacity
than initially contracted. If the total price for your
capacity
on the source network point is higher, you will be charged the difference additionally, as explained in the following example.To illustrate, the tariff of a VIP - VIP diversion for the months of January and July 2021 from a yearly contract for 2021. For the tariffs used for each product, check the ‘Total prices’ tab in Appendix 1 of the current TSC for 2021. All tariffs in this example have been rounded to two decimal places.
For      the capacities on the source network point for both the months in      question, the tariff is €0.15/kWh/h (€1.80/kWh/h multiplied by the term of      31/365).
For      the
capacity
on the target network point you contract at the auction      (assuming an auction premium does not apply) the total price is      €0.41/kWh/h for the January monthly
capacity
and €0.13/kWh/h for the July      monthly
capacity
.
After      registering the diversion, you will be charged the highest of the total      prices for the diverted monthly
capacity
on the target network point (a      VIP), i.e. €0.41/kWh/h for January and €0.15/kWh/h for July (instead of      €0.13).
You      will not be charged on the source network point for the diverted
capacity
.
VIP-VIP and FCFS-VIP diversions can be contracted only for monthly, quarterly and yearly
capacity
products, not for day and within-day products.
