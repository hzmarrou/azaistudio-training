As a
connected party
and owner of the
connection
building, you are responsible for safety.
As a
connected party
and owner of the
connection
building, you are responsible for safety. The safety regulations in the European Directive on safety in potentially explosive atmospheres (ATEX) apply to the installation in the
gas
delivery station as well as the space in which the installation is installed.
In the interests of safe working practices, you should always inform Gasunie of activities within the zone. You can contact our operational work preparation personnel for that. For the telephone numbers, see
“Safety Contact”
.
Classification of the building and consequences for electrical equipment
The safety classification for indoor spaces and the associated standards depends on the ventilation factor of these spaces (the number of times per
hour
that the content of the space is ventilated). Almost all
gas
delivery stations are ventilated less than five times per
hour
. Consequently the
gas
pressure regulation space is classified as zone 1. The space within a one meter radius of the ventilation openings and door openings on the outside of the
gas
pressure regulation space also comes within zone 1.
Gasunie has produced drawings of the zones at the station, on which
gas
pressure regulation space and the outside up to one meter away are classified as zone 1. This has consequences for the equipment used in this zone. Gasunie ensures that its installation complies with these regulations. It is your responsibility to ensure that the part of the installation that you own complies with the regulations.
Gasunie has the complete electrical installation at the station tested once every 8 years. Gasunie will inform you of any defects in your installation and will ask you to rectify them.
How do I show that my gas installation connection and gas installation comply with the legislation and regulations?
You must be able to show that the installation has been designed, manufactured and inspected according to the legislation and regulations applicable to this installation. You must be able to show that the installation has been maintained and inspected according to the applicable legislation and regulations throughout its use.
See "
Standards applicable to industrial installations
" and "Overview of European standards and developments in standards" for a full summary of the relevant guidelines and standards.
How can I determine the integrity of the gas pipelines?
New
gas
pipelines
Gas
pipelines designed for a pressure of >500mbar must be constructed according to the Pressure Equipment Directive. According to this directive, the design of a
gas
pipeline must be checked by an organisation designated for this purpose by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment (Notified Body, NoBo for short). The manufacturer or assembler should draw up an EU Declaration of Conformity for the product or combination of products supplied, as specified in the Pressure Equipment Directive.
Existing
gas
pipelines
The requirements applicable to using
gas
pipelines in a safe and environmentally-friendly manner are based on the Dutch Environmental Management Act. The act applies to organisations obliged to hold a permit and subject to disclosure obligations, however residential buildings are also covered. This is regulated in the Dutch Activities Decree Environmental Management (Decree providing general regulations for environmental management facilities (BARIM)).
The Dutch Activities Decree Environmental Management specifies that
gas
pipeline installations should be inspected periodically (once every 4 years). Depending on the pressure and diameter of the pipelines concerned, this may be performed by a company certified by the Foundation for Certification, Inspection and Maintenance of Combustion Plants (SCIOS), scope 7B or must be performed by a NoBo (
www.scios.nl)
. Providing details of the exact boundaries between both working areas is beyond the scope of these FAQ, you should therefore consult your installer or inspection body for precise information.
How can I determine the integrity of appliances that run on gas?
New standard
gas
appliances
Under the
Gas
Appliance Directive (GAD), new standard
gas
appliances, such as central heating boilers and hot air heating, are required to have a CE mark.For standard appliances, which have a CE mark, the installer must produce a report stating that the appliance has been set according to the manufacturer's settings.For standard appliances, or assemblies (cascade connections) being one combustion plant with a nominal
capacity
of >100 kw, which have a CE mark, a certified body must produce a report stating that the appliance has been set according to the manufacturer's settings. For more information, please go to: www.scios.nl.
New special
gas
appliances
A complete manufacturing file must be prepared by the manufacturer and assessed by a certified body for these appliances. The manufacturer or assembler of these appliances should also prepare an EU Declaration of Conformity. In the declaration of conformity, the manufacturer states which standards have been applied to the appliance.
Maintenance of existing appliances
Existing appliances should be maintained and inspected at the intervals specified by the manufacturer. Appliances or assemblies (cascade arrangements) with a
capacity
of  >100kW should be inspected every four years by a SCIOS-certified company. More information and a list of SCIOS-certified inspection and maintenance companies can be found on its website.
What documents need to be submitted when a gas equipment link is taken back into service?
If, at the request of the
connected party
, the
gas
installation
connection
is temporarily decommissioned for alterations, adaptations or repairs to the
gas
installation located behind the transfer point, such alterations or repairs must comply with the relevant legislation and regulations. This will usually involve an adaptation to the piping
system
or pipeline. See also "
which standards can I apply
?"
This adaptation or repair should be performed in a manner that demonstrates integrity. Integrity is demonstrated via an organisation accredited under the Commodities Act Decree on pressure equipment (Notified Body) or a certified inspection department (IVG). See also "What actions are taken when a
gas
delivery station (
GOS
) is brought into or taken out of operation?"
How is the cathodic protection of the gas installation connection checked from the transfer point to the point where the pipeline reappears above ground?
After the transfer point, cathodic protection is the responsibility of your organisation/company.
Control measurements should be taken in accordance with EN 12954;
The frequency of the measurements depends on a number of different factors but annual measurements generally suffice;
A limited power
supply
from the Gasunie network will remain available;
Any Gasunie-related identifying features on the cathodic protection posts behind the transfer point are removed.
What is the relevant legislation regarding the integrity and safety of gas installation connections?
A summary of the relevant legislation relating to the integrity of the
gas
installation
connection
is given in
"
Relevant legislation for industrial installations".
The Dutch Activities Decree Environmental Management specifies that not only appliances but also fuel
supply
lines must be inspected. The inspection of fuel
supply
lines consists of two parts:
SCIOS scope 7A for fuel lines with a working pressure of < 500mbar
SCIOS scope 7B or NoBo inspection for fuel lines with a working pressure of > 500mbar (SCIOS or NoBo inspection depends on the pressure and diameter of the pipeline)
The prescribed frequency of these inspections is once every four years. An extended test is also carried out once every eight years. The appliance inspection is performed at least once every four years. This period may be shorter if this is indicated on the most recent inspection report.
The environmental permit may contain varying or additional conditions.Safety requirements for
gas
delivery stations are summarised in "the regulations based on ATEX".

How high should the design pressure of the gas installation and the pipeline after the gas receiving station be?
The design pressure must always be higher than the pressure of the
gas
supplied by
Gas
Transport Services to the
connected party
. This is necessary because the regulated pressure is protected in the
GOS
by a safety relief valve and one or two cut-out safety features. A margin is necessary to ensure that this is set up to operate safely.
The relationship between the
supply
pressure (MOP: maximum operating pressure) and the maximum outlet pressure (MIP: maximum incidental pressure) of the
GOS
is shown in the table below.

The minimum design pressure of the
connected party
's
gas
system
depends on the highest setting (MIP) of the safety features in the
gas
delivery station and on the chosen design code/standard for the
connected party
's
system
. Based on this information, a Notified Body (NoBo) should determine the design pressure of the
connected party
's
gas
system
.
Up to what pressure is the connected party's network protected by the GOS?
We will agree the level of the normal
supply
pressure with you. The maximum pressure in the event of an incident is derived from the normal pressure.  See the question "What should be the design pressure of the
gas
installation
connection
and the
gas
installation after the
gas
receiving station?" for an overview of the normal (agreed) pressure for delivery and the maximum pressure in the event of an incident. You should ensure that the design pressure of your piping
system
or pipeline is suitable for the maximum incidental pressure outlet side (MIP) mentioned above. If appliances are connected to this
system
which do not operate normally if the
gas
pressure approaches MIP (see 2
nd
column), then these appliances must be protected against this. This can be done by using protective electrical or mechanical devices against overpressure.
Can gas be supplied from the gas delivery station to the connected party at a lower pressure than the normal supply pressure?
The
gas
pressure regulator in the
gas
receiving station usually comprises one
supply
gas
pressure regulator equipped with safety devices to reduce the
gas
pressure to the set value of the
gas
outlet pressure and a second, identical reserve
gas
pressure regulator. For higher capacities there are three
gas
pressure regulators (two supplying
gas
plus a reserve). In the event of a fault in the
supply
gas
pressure regulator or when maintenance work is being done, the reserve takes over the
gas
supply
at a lower pressure. To give an indication, the pressure can drop 0,3 bar in such circumstances in a
gas
receiving station with two
gas
pressure regulators. Where there are three
gas
pressure regulators, the pressure can drop by about 0,6 bar in the worst-case scenario. This can affect the settings of the low-pressure monitoring
system
in your
gas
consumption installation. You are therefore recommended to set the low-pressure monitoring
system
in your own installation to a minimum of 0, 4 to 0,7 bar (depending on the number of runs in the
gas
receiving station) lower than the settings of the
gas
receiving station, taking account of the loss of pressure across the connecting pipelines.
With which emission requirements must my combustion plant comply?
New emission requirements came into force in 2017 for existing medium-sized combustion plants that are being used by industries, companies and utility buildings.
Section 3.2.1 of the Dutch Activities Decree Environmental Management gives the emission limits for small and medium-sized combustion plants:
boiler plant, nominal
capacity
of 1 MW or more: article 3.10
boiler plant, nominal
capacity
of 400-1000 kW or more: article 3.10a
boiler plant, nominal
capacity
of 400 kW or less: article 3.10b
gas
turbine:
article 3.10d
diesel engine:
article 3.10e
gas
engine:
article 3.10f
The emission limits are based on the best available techniques for combating emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), hydrocarbons (CxHy) and total dust (TSP).
Possible ways of achieving this are:
Optimising the burner
Adapting the burner construction or installing new burner(s) and possibly boiler
Using flue
gas
recirculation
The requirements apply not only to new combustion plants but to all boilers, engines and
gas
turbines, i.e. also those constructed prior to 1 April 2010.
