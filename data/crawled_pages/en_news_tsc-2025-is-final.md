Based on the consultation, it has been added that the Tegelen network point will be decommissioned from 1 March 2025. This has been incorporated in appendix 1 and appendix 2b.
A
shipper
commented that the change in appendix 5 (art. 1.7) should be accompanied by an alternative way of (re)
nomination
via GasPort.
GTS
had already put this request on the wish list so that shippers whose
nomination
system
is unavailable have an alternative. This route is not needed as an alternative to the
GTS
nomination
system
.
GTS
'
nomination
system
is duplicated with an automatic fail-over, and partly because of this it has extremely high availability.
The TSC and all appendices can be found
here
. They will be in force as of 01-01-2025.
