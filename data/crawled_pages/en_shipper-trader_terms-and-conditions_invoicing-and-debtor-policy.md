Which types of invoice can you expect from
GTS
?
GTS
’s invoices consist of a cover sheet (PDF file) and a specification (XLS file). The PDF file is a summary showing the total amounts. The XLS file gives a detailed specification. The invoice specification always states the energy unit used; this is kWh by default for all invoice types unless otherwise specified.
We prepare these invoices at various times during the year. Most invoices, such as contracted, balancing, peak
supply
, exceeding and settlement invoices, are issued every month.  Some invoices are only sent once or twice a year, these are the
gas
heating and reconciliation invoices.
You can find out more about billing periods under "When can you expect which invoice?".
If you want to know which services are billed for and through which invoices, you can find this information under "Which invoices are used for which services?".

Invoices in Gasport
All invoices created by
GTS
, based on the contractual obligation customers enter into with
GTS
, are posted on Gasport. Under ‘Invoices’ a summary is shown of all invoices and specifications; credit and debit invoices, outstanding and paid invoices:
Under ‘Financial’ -> ‘Accounts payable’ you will find a summary of all outstanding debit invoices without specifications (the corresponding specification can be found under ‘Invoices’):
A Multi Factor Account (MFA) is required to access Gasport for viewing and downloading invoices and specifications; you can apply for this account by using the online services application form found on our
website
. As well as requesting access, the form also has an option to request an email alert whenever new invoices are posted on Gasport. This email alert is for information only and no rights may be derived from it.
How are outstanding invoices handled?
All new invoices are payable within 14 days of the invoice date. If an invoice (or part of an invoice) still remains unpaid after a reminder,
GTS
will start a debt collection procedure. The costs of a debt collection procedure are payable by the
customer
.
Debits and credit amounts with the same due date are automatically set off against each other by
GTS
.
Credit amounts will not be paid out as long as there is a debit amount outstanding greater than the credit. If there are several outstanding invoices and a credit amount available for offset, it is possible to agree in advance how to settle the outstanding items. If you would like to arrange this with us, please contact our
Customer Desk
.
Invoice for interest
At the beginning of each month, interest will be calculated on all overdue invoices, this will be charged to you on a separate invoice and posted on Gasport.For more information about how interest is calculated, see article 5.12.3 of the
TSC
.
If you have any further questions about this process, please contact the
Customer Desk
during working hours.
