The balancing regime uses Near Real Time (NRT) allocations to calculate the current
Portfolio Imbalance Signal
(POS).
At the end of a
gas month
, the accountable offline allocations are published. Click
this link
for an (indicative) overview when offline allocations will be available on Gasport/B2B.
Any differences between the NRT and offline allocations are settled against the
neutral gas price
of the relevant day. For every day in a month, the net difference between the NRT and the offline allocations is invoiced via the settlement invoice.
