The European PRISMA
capacity
booking platform facilitates shippers to book
capacity
on domestic entry and exit points (not including (virtual) interconnection points) on a 'first come, first served basis' (FCFS).
What has changed since 1 January 2020?
On 11 December 2018, the Dutch regulator Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) published its
decision
to change the tariff structures and conditions in the Tariff Code
Gas
TSO,
Transmission
Code
Gas
TSO, and the definitions code implementing the European network code on harmonised
transmission
tariff structures for
gas
(NC TAR). The new tariff structure became effective at the start of 2020. The main change, besides the introduction of 5
capacity
products, is an all-in postage stamp tariff for entry and exit points. For details, we refer to the
'terms and conditions'
section.
As of 2020, the
transmission capacity
that can be booked is split up into 5
capacity
products, i.e. yearly, quarterly, monthly, day and within-day products. These products can only be booked separately and each booking gets a unique booking ID. This is a change with respect to the procedure that was in place until the end of 2019. The following headlines will provide details of this
switch
and the resources that
GTS
is making available to help shippers book the best possible combination of FCFS
capacity
products. The FCFS-based booking process will also be explained.
Which
firm capacity
products can I book on domestic network points?
The new tariff structure distinguishes the same 5
capacity
products for domestic entry and exit points as are also used for the interconnection points, i.e. the yearly, quarterly, monthly, day and within-day
capacity
products. All these
capacity
products have the same start date, start time, and runtime as the standard
capacity
products for interconnection points. The only exception is the yearly
capacity
product, which can start from any
gas month
(for example: 01/02/2020 06:00) and then be effective for the subsequent 12 consecutive months.
Interruptible capacity
From 1 January 2021,
GTS
will also offer the
interruptible
within-day
capacity
product for domestic ('FCFS') network points via the PRISMA platform in addition to the firm within-day
capacity
product. Offering
interruptible capacity
had previously been made possible for the daily
capacity
product.
GTS
only offers
interruptible
products at FCFS network points where
firm capacity
is sold out or at risk of being sold out. In addition, when the booking behavior of shippers shows, or when shippers indicate to
GTS
that there is a greater need for
capacity
at an FCFS network point, we will investigate the possibilities of making extra
firm capacity
available at the relevant network point. In this way we always try to make (firm or
interruptible
)
capacity
available that meets the market needs.
What does the new tariff structure mean when making an FCFS booking for a period that is not the same as the runtime of a
capacity
product?
A booking can only be for one
capacity
product at a time, i.e. a yearly, quarterly, monthly, day or within-day
capacity
product. This ensures a 1-to-1 relationship between booking and
capacity
product from booking through to invoicing. If you want to book for a period other than one of the 5 'standard'
capacity
products, you will have to make multiple bookings. Example: you can book
capacity
from 1 February 2020 through to 1 July 2020 on a monthly booking for February and a quarterly booking for April to June.
Can
GTS
help me determine the best possible combination of FCFS-based
capacity
products?
Shippers are responsible for booking the right (combination of)
capacity
products. To help shippers choose the best possible combination of
capacity
products for booking periods or booking profiles, which in the pre-2020 tariff structure could be booked on one single booking,
GTS
has made two calculation tools available on its website. These calculation tools offer the following optimisation options:
Conversion of a non-flat or      profile booking for one year into the best possible combination of yearly,      quarterly and monthly
capacity
products ('calculation tool profiled      booking').
Conversion of a flat booking      for a booking period that is not the same as the runtime of a
capacity
product into the best possible combination of yearly, quarterly, monthly      and day
capacity
products ('calculation tool period booking').

Both these optimisation options recommend, based on the
user
’s input, the most economical combination of
capacity
products for the
customer
. These calculation tools let you determine the best possible combination before making a booking. Optimisation afterwards is also possible, albeit only on the condition that you have booked all
capacity
products on the same day and submitted an optimisation request to
GTS
. This kind of retroactive optimisation is described in Article 2.1.2 of the
Transmission
Code
Gas
TSO.
Despite the option to optimise the combination afterwards, please try to optimise beforehand as much as possible by using the calculation tool. Needless to say, we will be glad to help you with that. If you have any questions, feel free to contact our
Customer Desk
.
How do I book
capacity
products?
Capacity
can be booked on PRISMA by selecting the '
Transport
' section and then the '
FCFS booking
' subsection. PRISMA supports combined booking requests (contracting) and booking enquiries (availability check). Booking requests are automatically preceded by an explicit booking enquiry. The
shipper
is notified of the result of this enquiry (an internal check by
GTS
specifies whether the requested
capacity
is available or
GTS
offers an alternative) and can then proceed with the actual booking to register the
capacity
.
What booking lead time do I need to consider with FCFS Bookings ?
You can book your
capacity
until the
nomination
lead time (120 or 30 minutes before start of flow) has been reached. Please be aware of the processing time needed to pass the booking on to the
nomination
system
, most likely within 5 minutes. Therefore we advise you to book your
capacity
at least 30 minutes before that deadline and take some time (like 5 minutes) between booking and
nomination
. This way, if nominations are rejected because the booking is not fully processed, you can still re-nominate in time. The risk you would take otherwise is that you would not be able to use the first
hour
of your
capacity
contract.
What happens when I want more
capacity
than is available on PRISMA?
GTS
may need to process booking requests on PRISMA manually, such as when a
shipper
wants to book more
capacity
than available on the network point over the requested period.
GTS
will then send a reply saying that the request will be processed manually. If the requested
capacity
can be made available,
GTS
will let the
shipper
know; the
capacity
is subsequently allocated and the booking is finalised. If the requested
capacity
is not available, the
shipper
will receive a rejection notice.
What if I want to know first whether the
capacity
I want is available?
If a
shipper
is initially interested only in an availability check for the required
capacity
, the
shipper
can contact
GTS
'
Customer Desk
. We will then check whether the required
capacity
is available. If the
capacity
is available and the
shipper
wants to go ahead and book the
capacity
,
GTS
will make the requested
capacity
available on the requested point. The
shipper
can then book this
capacity
on PRISMA and the booking will also be confirmed to the
shipper
on PRISMA.
What if PRISMA is down?
There is an emergency procedure available when it turns out not to be possible to book
capacity
on PRISMA due to an outage. In such an exceptional situation, shippers can ask
GTS
to book
capacity
on their behalf by filling in the
'Entry and/or exit capacity request'
form, signing it, and emailing it to both
[email protected]
and
[email protected]
