What is the lead time for a communication test?
The lead time depends on a number of factors. If your IT
system
is suitable for electronic messaging or if you use a service provider who is familiar with
GTS
, then it will usually be possible to complete the process within a few weeks. The time required will also depend on how quickly staff respond and their availability. You should allow for a lead time of at least four weeks.
