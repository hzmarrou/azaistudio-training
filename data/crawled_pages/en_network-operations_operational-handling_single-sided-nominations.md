From late 2015, the European Commission stipulated in the CAM/
CMP
network codes that parties should be allowed to send Single-Sided Nominations (SSNs) at interconnection points (IPs).
This means that parties can use their
capacity
on both sides of the border point with only one
nomination
. This type of Single-Sided
Nomination
(SSN) should be sent to the ‘active’ TSO, which in turn forwards it to the adjacent (‘passive’) TSO via a DELORD (type ANC) message.
The introduction of the Single-Sided
Nomination
mechanism has led to ‘traditional’ nominations being called Double-Sided Nominations (DSN).
Before using the SSN mechanism, however, a number of conditions have to be met. First of all, the SSN mechanism should apply at the network point. The network points concerned can be found in appendix 1 of the TSC, in column ‘SingleSidedNom?’ Secondly, a
Nomination
Authorisation (NOMAUT) message is required. This is an authorisation indicating that one or more countershippers are entitled to nominate on your behalf at that specific network point. The use of Edig@s version 5.1 (or higher) is also a requirement and should only be used following successful testing between the two TSOs involved.
If you intend to use the Single-Sided
Nomination
mechanism, you should first contact our team
