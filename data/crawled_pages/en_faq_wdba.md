How often is a "Within-Day-Balancing Action '(WDBA) performed?
It is impossible to estimate in advance. We look 10 minutes and 15 minutes past the
hour
to the end of
hour
prediction of the SBS. If the prediction of the SBS at 10 minutes past the
hour
gives a reason to a WDBA, then an announcement is made in Gasport and a Request For Quote (RFQ) is placed on the trading screen of the ICE Endex. The announcement and the RFQ is an estimate of the volume and product placed on the within-day market of ICE Endex and is based on the latest information.
If the prediction of the SBS at 15 minutes past the
hour
still gives a reason to a WDBA, then an update of the announcement is made and again a Request For Quote (RFQ) is placed on the trading screen of ICE Endex.
If the prediction of the SBS for the next
hour
at 20 minutes past the
hour
gives a reason for a WBDA than an order is placed on the within-day market of ICE Endex.
The type of product for which the order is placed, is dependent on the color of the zone wherein the SBS is predicted. In the
light green zone
GTS
send an order for a WD product to the exchange with a lead time of 3 hours and 40 minutes with supplies for the remaining hours of the
gas day
. As an indication, an order that leads to a transaction at 12:20 will be delivered from 16:00 to 06:00. In the orange and
red zone
GTS
send an order for a Next-
Hour
product with a lead time of 40 minutes. The whole delivery takes place in one clock
hour
. An order for a Next
Hour
product that leads to a transaction at 12:20 has a delivery from 13:00 to 14:00.
How much gas does GTS call up when placing a WDBA?
The volume that must be called will be calculated as follows:
Difference between the anticipated final value of the SBS and the boundary value of the
dark green zone
.
The part that possibly is not yet delivered of a realized WDBA transaction is included in the determination of the volume of any new WDBA. This only applies for WDBA with the SBS in the light green area.
If the SBS is in the light-green zone, and the imbalance is less than the unbalance of the previous
hour
, no WDBA will take place.
Will the WDBA notification be visible on Gasport screen? We keep the Gasport POS/SBS page open at all times. What is the content of the notification?
The message that will be constructed has the following format:
GTS
