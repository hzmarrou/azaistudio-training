Shippers, approximately 200 in total, have a
transport contract
with
GTS
. In other words, they have
contracted capacity
at both an entry and an
exit point
(see entry and exit
system
). So a
shipper
brings a certain volume of natural
gas
into the ‘
GTS
system
’ at a contracted
entry point
and takes off the same volume of natural
gas
at a contracted
exit point
. A
shipper
can also book other services with us, such as our flexibility service.
