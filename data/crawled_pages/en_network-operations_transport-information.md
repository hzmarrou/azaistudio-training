Information about operating the
gas
transport
system
.
The source information comes from the physical
gas
transport
system
and is also only available in it. The sources of this information are      operating measurements, not accountable measurements, which means that      minor discrepancies are possible and there are sometimes significant      errors in the data. These errors can be ignored at an aggregation level of      daily values or greater.
It is possible that current values are not showed because of technical      faults. However, once the fault has been resolved, the missing data can be      requested subsequently via a report.
The data are shown with a slight delay.
In the past the amount of available nitrogen  and the quantity      of
QC
have been changed. On the website only the      actual amounts are shown. Historical amounts can be found in the reports.
