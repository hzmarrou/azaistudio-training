Congestion management
To prevent congestion at interconnection points (including virtual interconnection points), referred to as IPs and
VIPs
below,
GTS
has introduced the following
CMP
measures:
Surrender of
Capacity
Oversubscription & Buy-Back
Long-Term Use It Or Lose It
Surrender of
Capacity
(SoC)
Shippers can ask
GTS
to offer or reoffer previously
contracted capacity
on the auction platform PRISMA. More information about
SoC
can be found
here
.
Oversubscription & Buy-Back (OBB)
At IPs or
VIPs
with
contractual congestion
,
GTS
offers additional
capacity
(firm or
interruptible
) through its oversubscription and buy-back scheme (OBB).
GTS
determines the volume of OBB
capacity
made available for each IP/VIP and each auction product.
During an auction,
capacity
that has become available through an OBB scheme cannot be distinguished from
technical capacity
(firm or
interruptible
). There is therefore no operational difference between booked OBB
capacity
and booked regular
technical capacity
.
In the unlikely event that
contractual congestion
actually becomes
physical congestion
,
GTS
will take the measures necessary to clear the
physical congestion
. The best option for achieving this, without affecting the rights of shippers who have contracted OBB
capacity
, is to hold a buy-back auction on PRISMA. Capacities will be nominated or renominated in such a way that the
physical congestion
will be resolved.
Long-term use it or lose it (LT UIOLI)
When an IP/VIP is identified as a congestion point,
GTS
reports, in accordance with
CMP
requirements, the use of
capacity
contracted by a
shipper
to the Dutch Authority for Consumers and Markets, ACM. It is up to this regulator to decide whether a
shipper
should return its
capacity
(stating the proportion and period of time concerned) to
GTS
. The returned
capacity
is offered or reoffered by
GTS
at a PRISMA auction.
ACM (NL), CREG (BE) and OfGem (UK) have developed a shared vision of the criteria for imposing and applying LT UIOLI. You can find this vision
on their respective websites
.
