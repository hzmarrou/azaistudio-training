We are approaching the end of year 2024, and we are focusing on 2025, in which year we as
GTS
would like to serve you again through reliable
gas
transport
.
With this message we would like to remind you that the
capacity
for your
gas
purchase in 2025 must be booked with
GTS
before 1 December 2024 in order not to lose your "right to held
capacity
".
GTS
holds the
exit capacity
for directly connected parties (DA) until 1 December, as described in Article 2.1.2a. of the Transport Code
Gas
- LNB. This means that, until 1 December 2024,
GTS
will retain the
capacity
that is booked at your
exit point
(s) for the year 2024 also for the year 2025.
GTS
may not hold more
capacity
for your
exit point
(s) than is booked at that
exit point
in 2024. After 1 December, this right on 'retained
capacity
' will expire and the entire
transmission capacity
becomes available to the market.
To be sure of contracted
exit capacity
for the period starting on January 1 2025, this
capacity
should be booked at
GTS
before 1 December 2024 at 06:00 CET. In most cases you, as DA, will not book the required
capacity
yourself, as your
gas
supplier
is facilitating this for you. Although we have received many bookings for end-users (DA), this is far from being the case for all exit points. You can check with your
gas
supplier
whether the required
capacity
for your
exit point
has already been booked with
GTS
or request them to do so before 1 December 2024 06:00h CET.
For questions, please contact the
GTS
Connections Desk (via +31 (0) 50 521 2323 or
[email protected]
).
