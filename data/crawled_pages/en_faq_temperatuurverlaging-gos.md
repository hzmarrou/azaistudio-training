How is the setting of the outgoing temperature at gas receiving stations done and what savings does it provide?
Setting the outgoing temperature at a
gas
receiving station takes place as follows:
- The incoming
gas
is heated in a heat exchanger isobaric and adiabatic (at the same pressure and without heat exchange with the environment) to a certain temperature;
- The pressure of the
gas
is reduced with a regulator, whereby the
gas
temperature also drops. The pressure of the
gas
is reduced with a regulator, whereby the
gas
temperature is also lowered.
- The outgoing
gas
thus reaches the desired output pressure and temperature.
The process is shown schematically below:
In the above example, the inlet pressure and temperature are 40 barg and 10 °C respectively. Assuming G-
gas
, the enthalpy at that point is -18.4737 kJ/kg (with 0 °C and 0 bar as the reference situation with an enthalpy of zero).
At an exit temperature of 5°C and a pressure of 8 bar, the enthalpy of the
gas
is increased to 1.9549 kJ/kg. Because the expansion in the regulator is isenthalpic, the enthalpy between the heat exchanger and the regulator has also been 1.9549. It can then be calculated that at a pressure of 40 barg, the temperature at that point must have been 19.37 °C.
If we assume a flow rate of 1000 m3(n)/h, the mass flow through the street is 833.4 kg/h. The amount of heat to be delivered by the heat exchanger is then
833.4 x (1.9549 - -18.4737) = 17025 kJ/h.
The same can now be done for a situation in which the outgoing
gas
temperature is lowered to 3 °C. This is shown in the figure below.
It can be seen that the enthalpy of the outgoing
gas
has been reduced to -3.8576 kJ/kg, where a temperature of 16.70 °C belongs to a pressure of 40 barg (after the heat exchanger).
In this case, the heat supplied by the heat exchanger is therefore
833.4 x (-3.8576 - -18.4737) = 12181 kJ/h.
The difference between the set output temperatures of 5 and 2 °C therefore results in an energy saving of 17025 - 12181 kJ/h = 4844 kJ/h, or approx. 28.5%. In practice savings of 5% per degree Celsius are measured.
At what minimum gas temperature should the gas be delivered?
The MR
gas quality
prescribes a minimum
gas
temperature of 0°C.
GTS
therefore always delivers the
gas
warmer than 0°C.
At what temperature is the gas delivered after the temperature reduction?
The temperature to be delivered depends on the type of
gas
and the
gas
pressure. In general, high-calorific
gas
is very dry and can be supplied at 1°C for all
supply
pressures. Low-calorific
gas
is somewhat wetter and is delivered between 1°C and 7°C, depending on the delivery pressure. The proposed temperature for delivery is indicated in the letter you received from
GTS
about this subject.
At what temperature does the gas finally arrive?
The final temperature depends on the downstream network and the
connected party
and on further pressure reduction. For underground networks, the
gas
is usually warmed up by the soil. The average soil temperature is 7°C. The new delivery temperature is usually 3°C. This means that the
gas
is warmed up on the way. For above-ground networks, heating usually also takes place through the ambient air. Only on cold days can the
gas
cool down further. The temperature of the
gas
can drop further due to pressure reduction. A good rule of thumb is that a drop in pressure of 1 bar causes a drop in temperature of 0.5°C.
What does a connected party notice about the lower gas temperature?
In principle, connected parties will not notice anything of the temperature drop. As a rule, the proposed reduction is small and can be implemented without effect.
What are the effects of a large temperature drop?
If there is a large drop in temperature, it is advisable for a
connected party
's process engineer to discuss the possible effects with the
GTS
contact person. A
gas
turbine in particular can be sensitive to the temperature of the
gas
supplied. No effects are expected on other equipment.
Can ice be build up on the pipeline system of a connected party?
Theoretically, this is possible if there is a significant pressure reduction in the
connected party
's process.
What is the effect of ice accretion?
In general, no special effects are to be expected. In the case of regulators, it is necessary to check that breathing openings do not become blocked. A list of equipment and the extent to which this equipment is sensitive to icing is available.
What temperature is permissible in the network of the connected party with regard to the condensation of liquids?
Generally speaking, the failure of hydrocarbons must be prevented.
Gas
is currently very dry and in the short term there will be no adverse effects from a low temperature in the
connected party
's network. In the longer term, an accumulation of hydrocarbons may occur. For high calorific
gas
a minimum temperature of -3°C must be maintained. Below this limit, condensation of hydrocarbons can take place. For low-calorific
gas
, this temperature depends on the pressure. At a typical pressure of 8 bar the condensation temperature is 3°C under worst case conditions. If the
gas
is further reduced to, for example to, 0.1 bar, the temperature drops to approximately -0.5°C. Practical tests, carried out together with an RNB, indicate that no condensation occurs in their network.
GTS saves approximately 5% on heating costs per degree of temperature reduction. Will this increase the connected party's gas consumption?
Because the sensible heat of the
gas
is slightly lower, the
gas
consumption of the
connected party
will be tiny higher. Per degree of temperature reduction this will be 0,05 ‰. In practice this per mille is much lower due to the very rapid warming of the
gas
by the environment.
