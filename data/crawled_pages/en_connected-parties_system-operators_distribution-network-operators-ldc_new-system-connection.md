Distribution network
operators can request
GTS
for a new
system connection
.
What does a new
system connection
mean in practice?
A new
system connection
in the
national grid
means that
GTS
supplies a facility in the
national grid
consisting of pipelines, including necessary appliances, and the
measuring and control equipment
, by means of which
gas
is transferred from the
national grid
to the local
distribution network
.
The
distribution network
operator shall make a suitable site and building available for this
system connection
. Buildings shall comply with the requirements stipulated by
GTS
, as well as all valid laws, regulations and standards.
How do you apply for a new
system connection
?
A number of steps need to be completed when applying for a
system connection
in the grid:
Application form for a new
system connection
The first step is completion of an application form by the
distribution network
operator      in order to have a clear overview of the work involved for
GTS
.
Implementation agreement
GTS
will start a study to investigate the potential for constructing a
system connection
as soon as it has received the signed application form      from the
distribution network
operator. If the study shows that the
system connection
is      possible, we will send you an implementation agreement. This will contain,      among other things, a description of the work, a cost allocation and a      timetable. If a
distribution network
operator signs and returns this      implementation agreement to
GTS
it is instructing
GTS
to carry out the new
system connection
.
Building/construction of the
system connection
After instructions have been issued,
GTS
will start the construction of      the
system connection
.
System
connection agreement
The
distribution network
operator shall sign the annex to the
system
connection agreement
entitled “Technical Specifications” before the new
system connection
is put into operation.
