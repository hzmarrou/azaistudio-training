The
capacity
to be auctioned comprises not only available
technical capacity
but also includes
capacity
that shippers wish to offer on PRISMA under the
Surrender of Capacity
measures.
As part of the
Congestion Management
Procedures (
CMP
),
GTS
can offer Oversubscription & Buy Back (OBB)
capacity
at interconnection points (including virtual IPs) where there is
contractual congestion
.
The basic principle is that all
available capacity
at the interconnection points (including virtual IPs) is auctioned as bundled
capacity
. Based on the
capacity
offered by the TSOs, PRISMA determines how much
capacity
is offered as bundled
capacity
. If one TSO has offered more
capacity
than the other, this ‘extra’
capacity
will be offered by PRISMA as unbundled.
GTS
offers
interruptible capacity
if all
firm capacity
at an
interconnection point
(or virtual IP) is sold out.
Interruptible capacity
is offered at auction only as a DA
capacity
product.
